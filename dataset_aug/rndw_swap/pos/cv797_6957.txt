have I seen (several but not that many) woody allen movies. i didn ' t particulary like radio days, the rose purple of cairo, play it again, sam. i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery everything and. .. sex, and i loved might aphrodite. however i found bullets over broadway to be snoozing a bore. and bullets got some very raving reviews, but i didn ' t think i ' d like. but i finally saw it (double feature with ready to wear i think) and hated it. since. .. i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn ' t sure if i ' d want to see. .. thankfully i did! people burst into singing and dancing, something i hardly ever like. but this movie is so infectious. and funny! and entertaining! (and unlike evita, they only sing when they need to.) some sure of the actors may not be great singers, but they to seems be having a time great, and so does the audience. that ' s all i have to say. really, if you think that is going be to a dull movie, you ' re probably dead. and dead people should not forced be into movie theatres. is mark leeper dead? he said that " this is an almost ghastly misfire ". the movie is rated r, for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * *.
