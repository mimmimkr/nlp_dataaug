after bloody clashes and independence won, lumumba refused to pander to the belgians, who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo. officers their, particularly general janssens (rudi delhem) in the force publique, the congo ' s army, caused rebellions, undermining lumumba, who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals. with unrest building, moise tshombe (pascal nzonzi) and the province katanga of, which contained 70 percent of the country ' s resources, proclaimed secession. lumumba replaced janssens, making mobutu a colonel, and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu (maka kotto ), it but was too late. ' when you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies, ' lumumba prophesies of his own fate. peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly regarding lumumba ' s private life. peck ' s script illuminates bantu sayings like ' the hand that gives, rules ' when uses lumumba it with the american ambassador. peck ' s direction is less assured, with scenes many unfortunately playing like standard television fare. he s ' served well, though, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role. ebouaney is dynamic, radiating his character ' fierce s passion for his people and his country. lumumba ' s intelligence and ability to strategize, even as he ' s by cornered insurmountable odds, are given life by ebouaney. peck ' s subject and lead elevate actor his film above its mediocre production. " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney ' s performance makes the tragedy personally felt.
