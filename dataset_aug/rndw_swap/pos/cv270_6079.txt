this british follows import the (mis -) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths. there is marc renton (who narrates ), spud (the dim - witted one) sick boy (the sean connery obsessive ), and begbee (the violence obsessive ). powered by top a rate, but not top name soundtrack (iggy pop, sleeper, elastica, lou reed. ..) the follows film renton who gets clean, gets back into heroin and gets clean again. some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction - esque, and some is just dumb & dumber gross (the bed sheets) and stupid (the bb gun) although the film starts out on a comic note, it takes a sharp term in the middle, and becomes almost depressing. the film is on based an irving welsh novel bearing the same title. i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it. is an obscure gem that has been shadowed over in the us by such movies as mission and impossible id4. the film is hard to with follow the heavy accents of the actors. this is a very original film as, far as go films today. it definetly deserves multiple viewings (partly because of the slang and accents) jeremy dennison mr. orange @ centuryinter. net
