the happy bastard ' s 30 - second review: american pie the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with latest this yuk fest, filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty. if go you expecting dawson ' s creek, you ' re in for a problem. if your expectations are lower (and better, i might add ), you will enjoy the hell out of american pie. the movie casts several unknowns, with the only real recognizable one being sctv ' s own eugene levy as a happy - go - lucky dad. the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year out gets - get laid. that ' s pretty much it. throughout the movie, little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout, including memorable a scene involving an apple pie (i won ' t give it away, but you probably know it what is) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry. of course, the movie has slightly some sentimental bits, but they don ' t drag the movie ' s humor content down that bad. most of the actors get their job done but, it ' s levy who ' s a hoot, a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious " visual aids ". i couldn ' t stop laughing during this movie, and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references, then american pie is for you. if you ' re one those of " conservative " types, well, i ' ll bet you ' re having fun home at while this, park south, and austin powers ii plays in theatres, now aren ' t you?
