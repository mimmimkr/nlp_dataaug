the happy bastard ' s 30 - second review notting hill a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral, notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott, a very popular actress with a $ 15 million asking price for movies. one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a london simple resident (played by hugh grant ), and sparks somehow begin to fly. sure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with grant ' s slightly disgusting (but very hilarious) roommate spike, anna ' s pesky ex boyfriend - (alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ), and, on top of all that, those damn press. it ' s fresh a sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy, very different from, say a, stubborn father or " not the right time " like as seen in usual flicks. roberts is as terrific the astonishingly beautiful actress, and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl. in short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs particularly, provided spike by one. tee - shirt really says it all about him. in attempt an to turn on a woman, he shows the front of the shirt, says which: " you are the most beautiful woman in the world. " on the back? " fancy a f * * k? "
