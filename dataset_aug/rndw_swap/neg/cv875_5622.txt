everything in the phantom have you seen many times before there is and nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely skill no in setting up an exciting action sequence. billy zane is wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is given very little do to, and does very little with it. treat williams, looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie. only catherine zeta jones, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance. she energy has and spunk, which the movie needed much more of oh. yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won ' t even care about. the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, youre if looking for a fun family movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is a not good movie.
