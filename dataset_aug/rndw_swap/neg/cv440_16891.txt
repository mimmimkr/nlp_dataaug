the comet - disaster flick is a disaster alright. directed by tony scott (top gun) it, the tells story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth. and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble. jeez. after a great opening, in which an american spaceship, plus the city of new york, are completely destroyed a by comet shower, nasa detects said the asteroid and go into a frenzy. they hire the ' world s best oil driller (bruce willis ), and send him and his crew up into space fix to our globel problem. that ' s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier, isn ' t it? the action in armageddon are so over the top, , nonstop and too ludicrous for words, i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times. i was not alone. plus, to see a actor wonderful like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor ' s talents. the film is just a reel show to off a bunch of snazzy fx shots. the only real reason for making this film was to out somehow - perform deep impact. producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon.
