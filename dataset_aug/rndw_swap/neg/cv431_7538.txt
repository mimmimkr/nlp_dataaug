" shagadellic! ", " groovy, baby! " " smashing! " adorn the 1 / 4 page ad for this movie as tabbed " the # 1 comedy in america " as of may 8th. did we attend the same movie? ! 87 at minutes it seemed overlong, a like snl skit on steroids, and at any it length seemed unfunny. yes, the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills, and yes, the concept, dealing with a 60s secret agent pop / icon (played by myers) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy (dr. evil, also played by myers) in the present day, had a great deal of potential. fun and costumes scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty of dose bathroom humor. don ' t get me wrong, i like a good " bubbles in bathtub the joke " as much as the next person, but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money. but, the way things these work days in the movie business, all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and will people believe it. i do give this film stars because of the sets, costumes, and sadly, unmet potential.
