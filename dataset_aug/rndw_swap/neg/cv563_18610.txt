the thirteenth floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genre film making -. if i hadn ' t recently watched the matrix and open your eyes - - of both which are similar but far superior - - i might have been a little nicer to this picture. craig bierko makes an adequate hero as hall douglas, the rich co - creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for murder the of his (boss armin mueller - stahl ). that everything was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one, and characters stare at other each for maddeningly - long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level. the acting is okay, but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of, and features a script (co - penned by josef director rusnak loaded) with cliches and stock characters. there are individual scenes and ideas that work - - i like the thought of a sentient computer program - - but none of the film ' s strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree. producer roland emmerich, based on and this his previous directorial efforts, seems hell - bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science - fiction.
