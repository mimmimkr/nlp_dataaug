a couple of (criminals mario van peebles and loretta devine) move into a rich family ' s house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels. however, someone else steals the jewels before they are able to to get them. writer mario van peebles delivers a script clever with several unexpected plot twists, but mario director van undermines peebles his own high points with haphazard camera work, editing and pacing. it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark but, alas there was still more 35 to minutes go. daniel baldwin (can i ' t believe i ' m about to type this) gives the best performance in the film, the outshining other talented members of the cast.
