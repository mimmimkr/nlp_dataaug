what do you get when you rip - off good movies like allen woody ' s bananas and martin scorsese ' s after hours? you ' d think you ' get d the best of both films. instead you get woo. falling in somewhere between def jam ' s how to be a player (which was awful) and booty call (which was ok ), woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african - americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons. the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours, as woman wild woo (jada pinkett smith) goes out on a blind date with straight - laced tim (davidson tommy ). mayhem follows them. for some unknown reason (read: contrived screenplay) davidson puts with up all of woo ' s antics for the night entire, which include her destroying his bathroom mirror, stealing things from his house, violently questioning him (accusing and belittling him actually) about previous girlfriends, causing a riot in an elegant restaurant, and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn ' t tolerate. but for the sake this of bad movie? sure, not why? there are a few chuckles in the film, the best being the scene directly swiped from bananas. in this case, davidson is running from thugs, gets into a subway car as the doors are closing, starts to taunt the thugs, then the doors open back up again. a good joke, but a stolen one. another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams ' cameo himself as. movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so, and not one of them has ever been a hit. woo won ' t be one either. so why was it made? and more importantly, isn ' t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive? everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point.
