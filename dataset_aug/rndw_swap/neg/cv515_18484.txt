when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain, you know that you can expect nothing more a than b grade action movie. however, since this film also featured michael madsen, more than capable character actor, this time in the role of protagonist, the author this of review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt. however, the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana, policeman tough who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio (played by lynch ). however, the raid was only partially successful, montana and is getting the rap. so, he begins his own private war against gio, trying to penetrate organisation his pretending to be corrupt. in the process, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora (played by rosie vela) and starts relationship with her too. it although doesn ' t stink like many of the similar films can, inside edge is mostly b forgettable grade action routine. nobody in this film actually puts much effort, including madsen or lynch, and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke the. only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela, who, apart from showing her more than impressive looks, shows some of the singing talent too. however, this isn ' t enough reason for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would, in most likelihood forget, the next day.
