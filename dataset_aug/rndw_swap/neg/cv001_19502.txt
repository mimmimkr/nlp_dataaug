the happy bastard ' s quick movie review damn that y2k bug. it ' s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother (william this time) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has strangeness a to it when they kick the power back on. little do they know the power within. .. going for the and gore bringing on a few action sequences here and there, virus still feels very empty, like a movie going for all flash and no substance. we don ' t know the why was crew really out in the middle of nowhere, we don ' t know the origin of what took over the ship (that just a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ), and, of course, we don ' t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly. throughout here, it ' s just " hey, let ' s chase around these people with some robots ". the acting is below average, even from the likes of curtis. you ' re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20. sutherland is wasted and baldwin, well, he ' s acting like baldwin a, of course. the real star here are stan winston ' s robot design, some schnazzy cgi, and the occasional good gore shot, like picking into someone ' s brain. so, if robots and body parts really turn you on, here ' s movie your. otherwise, it ' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie.
