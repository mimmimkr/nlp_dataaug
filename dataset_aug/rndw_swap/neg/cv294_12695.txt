in this re - make of 1954 the japanese monster film, godzilla is transformed into " a jurassic park " copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town. although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while, gets it old fast. the film often makes no sense (a several - hundred foot tall hides beast in tunnels subway ), sports second - rate effects (the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ), lame jokes (ebert mayor and his assistant gene are never funny ), horrendous acting (even matthew broderick is dull) and an unbelievable love (story why would anyone want to get back with together maria pitillo ' s character? ). there are other elements of the film fall that flat, but going on would just be a waste of good words. only for die - hard creature feature fans, this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door. i couldn ' t. (michael redman has this written column for 23 years and has seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both " fear and loathing " and " godzilla " in the same evening. )
