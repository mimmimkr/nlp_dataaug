deserves recognition for: making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review: this is what feel - good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90 ' s: an hour - and - a - half commercial, disguised as an unnecessary remake, in which the defining image that is of a man grown launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his. ass (this between, rocketman, and george the of jungle, disney has recently eclipsed champion longtime troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film.) as the absent - minded professor who invents the titular computer - generated goop, a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly. the only thing that this made film borderline tolerable for me is newly my - founded but firm belief that writer / producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he ' s used comedic for effect in films like this and the odious home alone series. take your to kids see boogie nights instead.
