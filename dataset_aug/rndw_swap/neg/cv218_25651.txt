" american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer ' s attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple - ness zany and comedy. it ' s about an a + student (biggs as " paul ") who gets a scholarship to some college in york new city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora (suvari) a ditzy heroin - chic goth chick who has no ambition or self - respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick - boy " paul is. so we ' ve got a fish - out - water formula mixed with meet - cute romantic which comedy ideally should make for a good movie. unfortunately the screenplay atrocious and boring direction by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film. these characters are totally and unrealistic unbelievable - it ' s as if under everyone age 30 is a stoned raver. there ' s no background or details to anyone or anything, it ' s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other. not to mention the story itself which is virtually non - existant and contains so many plotholes it ' s like cheese swiss. even the basic editing is bad. if you ' re looking for a romantic comedy stay far from away this one because it is neither romantic nor funny. i saw this in a packed cinema opening on night and the audience barely laughed at all. if you ' ve seen the commericials you ' ve seen all the " funny " parts which (are all from the first five minutes ).
