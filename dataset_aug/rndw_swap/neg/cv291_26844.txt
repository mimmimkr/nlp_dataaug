movies can do two the big es very well: educate entertain and. in the best of all possible worlds, they accomplish both. on the red planet, they fail entirely. in the near future, a manned mission is to sent mars to observe primitive plant growth. this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be. after some mumbo - about jumbo an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to the reach fourth planet, the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does. the ground crew of people you couldn ' t care less is about trapped on the surface without food, water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog. the one potentially interesting character (carrie - anne moss) spends her alone time in the orbiting ship talking to a computer. attempting to graft " 2001 " esque space mysticism with " terminator " robot, horror first time director antony hoffman can ' t seem to figure out ' what s going on. neither can we. didn ' t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story? couldn ' t he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter? there are so many mis - steps. opportunity every to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction. why introduce the theme of faith vs. science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_? the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen. two hours later, they ' re still waiting. despite our greatest hopes, there is no life on the red planet.
