a big, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch, the great white hype stars samuel l. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay - per - view revenues is to " " invent a white contender (peter berg) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " (damon wayans ). (the logic is that people pay will more to see black vs. white than black vs. black.) he may be right, in an absurdly accurate way, but the film doesn ' t give us a reason to care. as scathing a sports spoof, hype is that just: unfunny, unfocused, , and at times, just plain pointless. as a commentary on race relations, it ' s even * less * effective. the dialogue is the best of this mess, lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs! " tony writers hendra and ron shelton also do good on street the slang, though we never hear enough of it. the script isn ' t strong enough, though, to support the camera aggressive work of director reginald hudlin (house party ). he comes across as absolute overkill. the great white hype * almost * turns around at the end, at the big match, when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock - proportions concert. with costumed dwarfs, gangsta rappers and, the " champ " dressed as death, only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should ' ve been.
