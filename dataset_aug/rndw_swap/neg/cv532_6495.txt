this is crap, but, honestly, what older audience american is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker - ing ex -? presidents especially when their supporting players in - clude dan aykroyd as the current in commander chief, lauren bacall as a former first lady, and john heard as the dan quayle - ish vice president. yup, you ' re talkin ' pre - sold property here and, for warner, brothers the perfect fit into their now - ritual grumpy old holiday men slot. for the non - discriminating viewer, my fellow americans is fine. the raw star power will alone have audiences applauding this atrocious political - thriller road - comedy. (they did in mine, heaven help. us) for the rest of us, the movie is immediately tiresome. the tone terrible is the and banter is worse. forget wit - - lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie. (has anyone counted the number of first penis references?) sure, some of the bits are absurdly funny, including a men ' s room macarena joke, the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels, and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men ' s march. the get there from here, though, you have to submit to one of most the offensively overbearing musical scores of all time. judas priest, is there a single moment of silence in this film? even the dialogue gets drowned out. what a waste.
