salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to the be main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets. who actors demand such salaries might be greedy, but in some instances they are quite justified because, many films would never be watched or even made without their participation. for proof can that be found even in the realm of low - budget, movies and one fine example is breakaway, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring (in) famous figure skater tonya harding. face tonya of harding is most prominently featured on movie ' s poster, but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra, attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster. one day she decides to retire, but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that. realising that her life suddenly became worthless, myra starts running for her life, followed by professional assassins. terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater. although tonya harding displays convincing martial abilities arts, her acting leaves much to be desired. on the other hand, her efforts disappointing are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality, believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that b gave - films a bad name. martin sheen ' s brother joe estevez, whose character looks like he had entered from another movies ' set, is the only bright spot of breakaway. unfortunately, he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding ' s silver screen debut proved to be her last film.
