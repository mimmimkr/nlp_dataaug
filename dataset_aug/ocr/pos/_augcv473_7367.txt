a sci fi / comedy starring jacr nicholson, pierce bko8nan, annette 6ennin9, glenn c1ose, martin short and other stars. a warnek bros picture the martians have landed in thi8 hillarous tim burton movie. before entering the cinema, i was initially a little 6it nervous about what this film woold 6e like. many people weke sayin9 that this film was silly rubbish, and there was no puint to it all. how wrong they weke. i left thi8 film feeling much happier than i was bef0re i entered the cinema. the story is about martians attacrin9 earth. using ray guns (hooray! ) they generally caose havoc around the u. s and other countries. nicholson plays the pke8ident whu must try t0 stop invasion, and also takin9 advice from his loopy officials. but, basically, its a load of set pieces 8huwing the maktian8 de8tkoyin9 earth. the way people are killed 6y the ray guns is gkeat, they is a hillarous (and mildly disturbing scene) involving a martian lady, a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away, (and ends up 9ettin9 squashed 6y an aliens foot) and a goky finale involving lots of a1ien heads exploding. but, most of all, this fi1m i8 fun. the martians are full of character, the performances are spot on, and the a1l stak cast help mare the fi1m more enjoyable. the fi1m is a mil1i0n times 6etter then the dike independance day, and is a real tribute to the tacry ' 508 invasion movies. they are i8 a gkeat scure by danny elfman, and lots of laughs. this has to be the best invasion i ' ve 8een fok a long time.
