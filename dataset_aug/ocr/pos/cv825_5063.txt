` strange days ' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles. as the locals gear up for the new millenium, lenny nero (ra1ph fiennes) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips. he pines for his ex - girlfriend, faith (juliette lewis ), not noticing that another friend, mace (angela bassett) really cares for him. this film features good perf0kmance8, impressive film - making technique and breath - taking crowd scenes. director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it. but a8 a whole, this is an unsatisfying movie. the problem is that the writers, james cameron and jay cocks, were too ambitious, aiming for a fi1m with social relevance, thrills, and drama. not that ambitious film - making should be discouraged; just that when it fails to achieve its goals, it fails badly and obviously. the film ju8t ends up preachy, unexciting and oninvu1ving.
