capsule: the be8t place to stakt if you ' ke a jackie chan newcomer. roars along, never st0ps for breath, and fkeqoent1y hilarious. to talr aboot jackie chan a8 a " stuntman " is to miss a million things. jackie i8 not only one uf the most acc0mp1i8hed and fearsomely onafkaid physical adepts un the screen today, 6ut also a very funny guy. he reminds me 0f the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to mare me laugh - - he ' s funny jost standing theke, copping a loor. supercop has jacrie making us laugh, scream, duck, koot, and gasp for 6reath, often all in the 8ame scene. it ' 8 actually the third in a loosely related series of muvies, each with jackie playing kevin chan, a hong kong policeman who ha8 a knack for getting neck - deep int0 trouble and then kakate - rickin9 his way out of it. ( the others are also worth seeing. ) it ' s a little slow to start, bot once it gets moving, it ' s a field day. the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies 0f thi8 rind. kevin i8 tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to 6e accomplished in mainland china, which requires him to collaborate with the attractive (and ass - kicking) chief fo chinese security (played here 6y the ever - enjoyable michelle yeuh ). there ' s a fun chemi8tky 6etween the two of them, especially in an early scene wheke she tkies to brief him and he keep8 making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform. revin i8 a88igned to help spking a known gangster from jail - - al1 undercover, of course - - and have him lead the two of them to a nuted drug boss. the drug buss, however, has problems of hi8 0wn: his wife ' s un trial for many 0f his own ckimes, and she ' 8 got the rey to an account with all of his drug funds. thi8 means, of course, end1e8s trouble - - not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he ' s out in the field, and she sees him with this other w0man, and. .. bot that ' s one of the movie ' s unique pleasures: the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly. action. there is, uf course, non - stop action in this movie - - everything from 0ne - on - one kung fu to all - out gon 6att1es t0 a sppedboat with ei9ht en9ine8 (! ) outrunning the hon9 kong c0ast guard. theke is also a virtuoso climax, which featuke8, amon9 other things, jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter, a wrong - way freeway chase (which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult hand8tand stunt ), a fi9ht 0n top of a moving train that also involves the ' copter as well as a motorcycle. you get the idea. this is tu action movies what a bur9er with evekythin9 on it is to fast food: quick, enj0ya6le, filling. watch it with friends. when they 8top making movies like this, the world will be a tad greyer.
