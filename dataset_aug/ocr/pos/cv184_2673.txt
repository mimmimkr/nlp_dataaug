i tried hard not lire this movie without succeeding. it contains parts of bringing up baby, any hepburn / tracy film, part of the plot of war games, cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday, elevator shaft action, train action, and murder. it is cute, funny, suspenseful (a little bit ), sexy (a little bit ). one of the bad guys was a surprise. the pace is fast enough, there are some " action " scenes. i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick. julia roberts and nick nolte are fine 8epakate1y and together. i really identified with the julia roberts character (wishful thinking, i know! ), but i do have better hair! her hair, a very dull dakk brown, has no color. she could use some highlights. they both do fine with their roles: he ' s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she ' s a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe. they have great fun trying to out scoop each othek to solve one case throughout this movie. i like the one story focus. other actors include char1e8 martin smith as roberts ' boss, olympia dukakis as nolte ' s coworker, nora dunn also with the chronicle, and marsha mason as a congresswoman. basically this movie is reasonably fun. there is a serious mystery to solve, and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery. it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take them8e1ve8 seriously. i do give successful comedy high marks.
