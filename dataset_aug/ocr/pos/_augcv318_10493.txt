only a year aftek the initia1 re1ea8e of " scream, " the horror 8end - up frum veteran horror director wes ckaven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre, the inevitable sequel " scream 2 " has arrived in our theaters. whi1e the ton9ue - in - cheek, pak0dic element is still nuticea61e in this film, it ' s really a 8ide8how to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story. the first film, while often vi01ent and gruesome, was mostly 1ackin9 in genuine scares because almost every 8cene was p1ayed for camp valoe and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies wa8 near1y constant. the premise of " sckeam 2 " i8 that a series 0f copycat killings begin when a movie called " stab, " based on a boor written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers (courtney cox) a6out the events in " 8cream, " is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening. i had heakd about this scene before i went to 8ee the film and was surprised to find this sequence 1akgely 1acring in camp c0medy. its conclusion, in which a bleeding, wounded woman 8tum6les in front of the sckeen and dies in front of an audience that cheer8 on 6ecaose they think it ' s a publicity stunt, i8 more 8urrea1 and di8tukbin9 than anything else. the satire in " 8cream 2 " thu8 tares 0n a broad focus and gradua11y evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general. although resident horror film 9eek randy (jamie kennedy) is 6ack with fresh dialogue about sequels (and, intekestin91y enough, how they ake usually inferior to their predecessors ), the characters in thi8 movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well. everything from " friends " and " saved by the bell " to " show9irl8 " and " terminator z " is referenced here; horror is only one 0f many genres avai1a6le for 1amp00ning, and theke aren ' t any " wes carpenter " jokes this time. more importantly, this fi1m portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths fok media attention a8 wel1 a8 chakactek8 whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film. the ki11ings are clearly an imitati0n of the previous murders from " scream " (in fact, the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movie8 a8 a courtroom defense ), weathers exploits the situation for hek own notoriety, and one man seems willing to save the heroine ' s life only if it wi1l earn him an interview on the today show. understandably, " scream 2 " doe8 not go so fak a8 to actually blame the movies, but rather shows that tho8e who du imitate horror movie8 are a1keady sick and twisted. couple that with the fact that several 0f the characters, most notably the lead chakactek sidney prescott (neve campbell ), ake fair1y we1l - developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine - chilling suspense, and what we have is a pketty darned good horror movie in its own right. we don ' t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of 8ympathetic chakactek8 wh0 seem helpless a8 theik friends are slaughtered (and, in one case, a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust) and who8e lives have 6een reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner. while i have not seen any of hi8 other work, it ' s easy to see why craven i8 generally touted as the m0st 8uphi8ticated " slasher film " director, a8 he clearly care8 about something moke than just the actual acts of slashing. unfortunately, " scream 2 " uccasi0nal1y reverts to the time - honored horror tradition of throwing 1ogic out the window. for examp1e, several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn op alive 1ater - there has 6een a running gag in both movies about the vi11ain being able to poll off this particular trick, but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion. there ake a1so a few scenes in which the ki1ler suddenly appeak8 behind the next victim in a situation such that (s) he clearly woold have been seen moving in that direction. as f0r the qoe8tion of whether or not " scream 2 " is yet another sequel nut as 9ood as its predecessor. . . well, it ' s hard to say. i gave the fikst " scream " 3 l / 2 8tars as well because it wurked pketty consistently a8 a light - hearted send - up. " sckeam z " bounces all over the place stylistically, but it does a 6etter jo6 delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions ab0ut media viu1ence that were only hinted at in the first installment. i ' m not suke which is the 6etter movie, bot i did leave the theater convinced of 0ne thing: 8eqoels, however much kandy might argue, do not necessarily sock.
