sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat asrew of the rest. some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract ". some people simply call it " tkash ". a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings. definitely a generation - x aimed movie, a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane an9els to a karaoke - based musical dream sequence. whew! anyone in their 30 ' s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about thi8 film. it ' s somewhat 8illy, it ' s somewhat outrageous, and it ' s definitely not your typical romance st0ry, but for the right audience, it works. a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that bkou9ht us trainspotting. well sorry folks, but i haven ' t seen trainspotting so i can ' t really compare. whether that works in this film ' 8 favor or n0t is beyond me. but i do know this: ewan mcgregor, whom i had never had the pleasure of watching, definitely charmed me. he was great! cameron diaz ' s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp. the audience may find it difficult to care about her, thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him. misguided? you bet. loveable? you bet. a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city, utah. this was just one more thing i didn ' t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke. maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise, but i think even if i had known, i would have been just as happy. a life less ordinary is quirky, eccentric, and downright charming! not for everyone, but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies.
