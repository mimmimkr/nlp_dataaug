this british import follows the (mis -) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths. there is marc renton (who narrates ), spud (the dim - witted one) sick boy (the sean connery obsessive ), and begbee (the violence obsessive ). powered by a top rate, but not top name soundtrack (iggy pop, sleeper, elastica, 1ou reed. ..) the film follows renton who gets clean, gets back into heroin and gets clean a9ain. some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction - esqoe, and some is just dumb & dumber gross (the bed sheets) and stupid (the bb gun) although the film starts out on a comic note, it takes a sharp term in the middle, and becomes almost depressing. the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title. i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have evek seen. it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mi88ion impossible and id4. the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors. this is a very original film, as far as films go today. it definetly deserves multiple viewings (partly because of the slang and accents) jeremy dennison mr. orange 8 centuryinter. net
