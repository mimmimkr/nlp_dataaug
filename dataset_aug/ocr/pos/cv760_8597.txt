the " italian hitchcock " and acknowledged master of the giallo murder - mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena. this time the twi8t comes in the form of jennifer corvino (jennifer connelly ), a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects. sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland, she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school ' s population terrified. a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist (donald pleasance) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift. phenomena is an imaginative, original thriller. writer / director argento creates several sequences of surreal, haunting beauty here, including a masterfully shot s1eepwalrin9 episode and a stkikin9 scene when a swarm uf flying insects descends on the school at jennifer ' s beckoning. the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer ' s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising. the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden, ex - rolling stone 6ill wyman, and argento ' s favourite gothic / electronic outfit goblin. but it gels surprisingly well. the film ' s opening music reccurs several times, an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone. ar9entu fans beware: the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re - titled as creepers. this deleted nearly half an hour uf footage, mainly of key dialogue scenes.
