aspiring broadway composer robert (aarun williams) secretly carries a torch for his best friend, struggling actor marc (michael shawn lucas ). the problem is, makc only has eyes for " perfect 10s, " which the geeky, insecure robert certainly is not. meanwhile, marc ' s spoiled (hetero) female roommate, cynthia (mara hobel ), spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown. writer - director victor mignatti ' s " very romantic comedy " (as the ad campaign states) is supposed to be (pardon the pun) a gay ol ' romp, but it ' s hard tu have much fun with these annoying, self - absorbed characters and theik shallow personal problems: marc and cynthia have sitcom - level domestic " crises " (such as trying to kill bugs - - how hilarious ); robert and marc go to acting class (how riveting ); the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges (how original ). but more than anything else, the three whine. constantly. marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent " 40, " david (hugh panaro ), the hunky musician fr0m across the way; robert whines about not being able to find the right guy; cynthia whines about having to find a job (horrors ). the terrible tri0 whine their way to a happy ending that is wholly undeserved. add in overly broad performances and some laughable lipsynching by panaro, and you ' re left with one astonishing piece of cinematic damage.
