vampire ' s is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, feed vampires, readied to be bashed or beaten - till one ' s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie. to make matters worse, the buffoons that go hunting vampires ake all rednecks, and deserve to have their heads bitten off, if not, their bodies carved in half. the dilemma of hating the? heroes ' as much as the? villains ', makes one wish that the? hand uf god ' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion. james wood portrays jack crow, a man obsessed with killing vampires, whose 8oul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed his parents ), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires. as for adam 6a1dwin, he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts? action ', and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex. as for the claims that the catholic church created? dracula ', well that is the 8econd most sacrilegious suggestion, outside the fact that pkie8ts and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury, with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame. an awfol movie on all counts, my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent, rude vampire slayers.
