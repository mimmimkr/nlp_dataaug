everything in the phantom you have 8een many times before and there is nothing new presented here. wincek displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence. billy 2ane is wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is given veky little to do, and does very little with it. treat williams, looking like rhett butler 6ut sounding like mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie. only catherine zeta jones, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance. she ha8 energy and spunk, which the movie needed much more of. 0h yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so pookly played out you won ' t even care. about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if youre looking for a fun family movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is nut a good movie.
