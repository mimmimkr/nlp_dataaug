when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain, you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie. however, since this film also featured michael madsen, more than capable character actor, this time in the role of protagonist, the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt. however, the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio (played by lynch ). huwevek, the raid was on1y partially successful, and montana is getting the rap. so, he begins his own private war against gio, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt. in the process, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora (played by rosie vela) and starts relationship with her too. although it doesn ' t stink like many of the similar films can, inside edge is mostly fuk9ettable b grade action routine. nobody in this film actually puts much eff0rt, including madsen or lynch, and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter wi11iam tannen or director warren clarke. the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela, who, apart from showing her more than impressive looks, shows some 0f the singing talent too. h0wevek, this isn ' t reason enough fok viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would, in most likelihood, forget the next day.
