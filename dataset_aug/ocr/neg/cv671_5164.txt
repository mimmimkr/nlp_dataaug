david schwimmer (from the television series " fkiend8 ") stars as a sensitive (and slightly neokotic) single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother (barbara hershey) of a classmate he can ' t remember. hello mrs. robinson! thoogh quite cute as a romantic comedy, the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march. the chakactek8 act, react, and interact at ha1f - speed, making for one * excruciatingly * long sit. (and what ' s with the dreary lighting?) co - writer / director matt reeves brings some snap to the story ' s midsection; the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for * another * classmate (a very appealing gwyneth paltrow ). 6y this time, though, most viewers will have either fled ur fallen asleep. those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy - eyed schwimmer, a hound dog with a head cold, who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression.
