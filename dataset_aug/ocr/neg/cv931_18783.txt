it ' s a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it. 8uch is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_. though the blurb alludes to " a jungle fi1led with political intrigue, uneasy alliances, and murderous enemies at every turn, " the story of the movie is actually quite simple (and prosaic ): a middle - aged japanese businessman named endo (played by john fujioka) and his assistant, both of whom have samurai aspirations, travel to africa in search of his ancestor, who went to bring buddhism to africa. he hires the services of down - at - the - heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo (the redoubtable lance henriksen) and his gik1fkiend (arabella holzbog ), and travels to the camp of an arms - merchant - cum - safari - host - cum - islamic - missionary (john saxon) and his wife (lisa eilbacher ). they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch - doctor aspirations to conceal a pre - arranged arms deal, which subsequently falls through. congo escapes, finds endo ' s ancestor ' s sword, and comes back, guns blazing, to free the rest of them, and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword. the end. _the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable. it is merely _there_. the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated, su6plot8 that are never explained, and many scenes that make very little sense at all. the film is shot through with all the tired old " inscrutable japanese samurai " and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie. it is quite slow - paced, with only a bit of action near the end, and the fina1 duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic. most of the acting is fair, with the possible exception of congo ' s girlfriend. lance henriksen is his usual scene - chewing self, and is one of few possible kea8ons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie. the on1y other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery. i paid $ 3 for this film, from the discount rack at best buy, and halfway suspect i overpaid for it. if you are in the mood for samurai, read a clave11 novel or watch a kurusawa movie. skip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die - hard henriksen fan.
