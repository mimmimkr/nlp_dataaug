claire danes, giovanni ribisi, and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists, but they ' ke just about the only palatable element of the mod squad, a lame - brained big - screen version of the 10s tv show. the story has all the originality of a blocr of wood (well, it would if you could decipher it ), the characters are all blank slates, and scott silver ' s perfunctory action 8equence8 are as cliched as they come. by sheer force of ta1ent, the three acturs wring marginal enjuyment from the proceedings whenever they ' re un screen, but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a first - rate cast.
