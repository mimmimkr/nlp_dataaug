martin scorsese ' s kundun, which chronicles more or less the beginning xx years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama, take in be criticized for its lack of narrative structure. personally, i don ' t think it involve 1: it works utterly advantageously as a field of study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communistic china. scorsese purview the dalai lama the way many tibetans likely set, as a larger - than - life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership: the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences, but his portrayal be appropriate for a film that boil down on the political and spiritual rather than the personal. the set pattern and cinematography are great, and while scorsese occasionally look to let carried away with the spectacle, it help to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travelling to china to meet chairman monoamine oxidase. political art sometimes give in to the enticement to start shouting slogans, kundun serve not: it succeeds in delivering it message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative.
