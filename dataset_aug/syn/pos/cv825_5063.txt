` strange days ' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles. as the locals gear up for the new millenium, lenny nero (ralph fiennes) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips. he pines for his ex - girlfriend, organized religion (juliette meriwether lewis ), not note that another friend, mace (angela bassett) really cares for him. this movie features good performances, impressive film - making technique and breath - taking crowd scenes. director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to apply it. but as a whole, this is an unsatisfying motion picture. the problem is that the writers, james cameron and jay cocks, were too challenging, aiming for a photographic film with social relevance, thrills, and drama. not that ambitious film - making should be discouraged; just that when it fails to achieve its goals, it fails badly and obviously. the film just ends up preachy, unexciting and uninvolving.
