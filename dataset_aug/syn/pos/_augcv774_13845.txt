almost a replete decade before steven steven spielberg ' s saving individual ryan asked whether a film could follow both " anti war " and " pro - soldier ", john irvin ' s burger hill proved information technology could. lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greet oliver rock ' s platoon, this fantabulous photographic film was fire as " too militaristic ". it ' s hard to understand exactly why - - - unless irvin, in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable (and often unenlightened) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle, - - - has refused to present u.s. with the oliver stone killer, drug - stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the polack, the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii flick. ground beef hill, base on a true story, is not an easy movie to catch. there is a vista that will have gray anti - war activist wrestle in their seats, or moved to genuine tears. and the climactic final assault on the " j. j. hill " in question is visually puzzling. gristly reality are presented in brief flare, as if the learning ability dared not acknowledge what it had encountered. and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee, veteran and " newbie ", disgraceful soldier and ashen, get almost indistinguishable from each early, as they do in the chaos of factual combat. the act throughout be solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney vitamin b complex. vance as doc - - in a role that bequeath have many unconditionally disbelieving that this is like actor they cheered as " nellie bly casey jones " in mctiernan ' s red october. if you ' ve seen private ryan, you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill - - if only to make up one's mind that the all the valour and repugnance of spielberg ' s vision was as present in the ashau valley as information technology was at omaha beach.
