in " magic town ", jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a poll taker who heads to a " perfect " town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll - takers care about. however, as time work up, and he finds himself falling in love with the town (and a woman ), he begins to see that what atomic number 2 ' s doing is wrong. the plot is standard stuff, but that ' s not important. in a film like this, it ' s the calibre of the actors that make or break it. obviously, since stewart stars, that ' s practically a non - issue. he ' s great in the film, as common. there ' s just something about him that always manages to be endearing, even when he ' s deceiving the town folk. you ' re always on his side, and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition. the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script - writer, and it shows. this is the type of feel - good picture that capra is famous for. by the time " the end " shows up on screen, everything have been wrapped up very nicely. there live no loose ends, and virtually every character gets a happy ending (those that deserve one, anyway ). in this age of cynicism, it ' s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat. " magic town " is a delightfully entertaining motion picture. if you consider all old movies are slow - paced, you ' d be well - advised to check this one out.
