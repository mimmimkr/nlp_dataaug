synopsis: bobby garfield (yelchin) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother (hope davis ). bobby ' s world revolves around his friends, especially the spritely carol (boorem ). then single day, a new boarder arrives at bobby ' s house. ted brautigan (hopkins) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking. as the bond between bobby and ted deepens, bobby becomes privy to ted ' s great secret, an event which will change both of their lives forever. review: a small but enchanting movie, " hearts in atlantis " easily recalls another king - inspired coming - of - age film, " stand by me ", both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys. " hearts " is a tribute to the magic of childhood, to those summers when the days seem neverending, and nothing means more than your closest friends. unlike " stand by pine tree state ", there is a supernatural element to " hearts ", merely although it is key to the plot of ground, it is not prominent. like " stand by me ", this is a mostly character - driven film, and as such it benefits greatly from superb cast. yelchin is very good as bobby, finding a good mix of pureness and resignation. more splendid still is boorem, whom i praised highly for her work in " along came a spider " and who is simply radiant here as carol. and then there is hopkins, who despite playing such a quiet, introspective character as ted, nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen. less successful is davis, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish. i also found it odd that bobby and carol ' s other friend, sully (whose death as an adult sets up the movie ' s flashback framing device ), is paid virtually no attention. but hicks ' direction is lovely without being cloying, and despite the movie ' s general lack of incident, it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience.
