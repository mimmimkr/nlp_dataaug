my fellow american is a movie that at world class glance looks to have little sum (oregon a movie that we ' ve all seen a million times ), ii life contender thrown together and then the fun start out. this is exactly what happened in this moving picture, but fortunately, they handle to do it in an interesting and peculiar way. the movie begin with a quick (and i serve mean quick) glance of two united states president russell kramer (jack john uhler) and mat stephen a. douglas (jesse james garner ). william haney (dan aykroyd) and ted matthews (john heard) are the new chairperson and frailty chair. there is a scandal that turn out involve a kickback from a contractor and haney is prescribed that he forget that yr ago. he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone need kramer and douglas dead. this film was exceptional for many rationality. one and only exist that they found people (lemmon and granary) that have good chemisty unitedly. they worked rattling easily as a building block and they mirror each other perfectly, one being a noblewoman man and nonpareil being the old man (one ' ll let you fiqure which is which ). likewise, they found people that bed their parts as govenment officials good. information technology look to me that garner played almost incisively the like role that atomic number 2 played in the distinquished gentleman (except then he equal a congresswoman ). experience counts for a plenty!!
