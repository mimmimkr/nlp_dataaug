in i of my many video i have achieve from the local library, casablanca was my tertiary classic in some weeks. the others being citizen kane and giddiness (yes, i am assay to catch as many of afi ' s greatest movie ever made as i can ). just, casablanca digest out from the rest for me: it was actually watchable. what most hail as the great american film e'er, casablanca isn ' thyroxin hence much a love story as a political frenzy with a love trigon throw off in. information technology seems that whizz humphry bogart drop about 85 pct of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred ingmar bergman. that nettle me, as did the cease. wherefore didn ' t the program turn about? !? astonishingly, ane enjoyed the film. i liked bogart ' s character and his acting (not complete the top as most actors in his era ). i once read about if you own a option to exist in a moving picture show, which i would it be, and a women said casablanca. at first one constitute thinking to myself " why? " and so, as i watched the celluloid again, ane understood why. the moving picture is real considerably coif and the script top - notch, although i doubt i understood more than than half of the political mumbo jumbo. casablanca make up, in my mind, no classic (like solaris ), merely information technology is a good film and stylishly injection. hey, hollywood, how astir this: a remaking with harrison ford and anne heche? straight off that would embody a classic.
