it ' s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year, but that is what disney and pixar animation; s latest film represents. while a bugs life isn ' t nearly equally deep as it ' s predecessor, dreamwork ' s antz, it is just as funny. a bug ' s life sentence centers, appropriately, around the life of an ant, named flik. flik, cutely voiced by newsradio ' s david foley, hates sticking too tradition and attempts excessively find new ways of harvesting food and other task. when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost, the leaders of the colony send him come out on a mission too get him out of the way. the offering is food that a vile group of hopper force the ants too harvest for them. the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey. when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the measure of food. when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission, they never daydream he will be successful, they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the superfluous food. flik ' s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return. instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors. when he returns with the ` warriors ', the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes. a bug ' s life has animation that is simply stunning. the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative. together with the great voice acting, this film is the perfect holiday family film. its main weakness is that it couldn ' t beat antz to the theaters, making it seem like stale material.
