a sci fi / funniness star knave nicholson, president pierce brosnan, annette benning, john herschel glenn jr. close, dino paul crocetti short and other stars. a charles dudley warner bros picture the martians hold landed in this hillarous tim burton motion picture. before entering the movie theater, i was ab initio a little bit nervous about what this plastic film would comprise similar. many people were saying that this film be silly rubbish, and at that place was no point to it all. how wrong they were. i left this motion picture show feeling much happier than i was before single entered the cinema. the chronicle is about martians attacking worldly concern. using shaft of light gun (hooray! ) they generally cause havoc around the u. due south and other state. nicholson plays the president world health organization must try to stop invasion, and as well taking advice from his loopy officials. but, fundamentally, its a load of set piece showing the martian destroying earth. the way citizenry are killed by the ray guns is great, they is a hillarous (and gently disturbing scene) involving a martian gentlewoman, a crazy general who just need to microwave the aliens away, (and end up getting squelch by an aliens foot) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding. merely, most of all, this photographic film be fun. the martians are wide cut of character reference, the public presentation exist spot on, and the all star cast help lay down the film more pleasurable. the celluloid is a million meter well then the dire independance daytime, and cost a real testimonial to the tacky ' 50s invasion movies. they are personify a great score by danny elfman, and lots of laughs. this has to be the best invasion iodin ' ve seen for a foresighted time.
