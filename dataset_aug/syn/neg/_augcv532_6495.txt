this is crap, merely, honestly, what previous american audience is going to be capable to resist seeing jack jack lemmon and king james i earn as bicker - ing outmoded - presidents? especially when their supporting histrion in - clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in foreman, lauren bacall as a former maiden madam, and john heard as the dan quayle - ish vice president. yup, you ' re talkin ' pre - sold property hither and, for warner crony, the perfect burst into their now - ritual grumpy old homo vacation slot. for the non - single out viewer, my fellow american is fine. the raw superstar power alone will have audiences applaud this abominable political - thriller road - comedy. ( they exercise in mine, heaven help us. ) for the rest of u, the pic is immediately tiresome. the tone follow terrible and the give and take be worse. forget wit - - lemmon and granary simply exchange profanities through most of the picture. ( has anyone reckon the number of first member references? ) sure, some of the fleck are absurdly funny, admit a men ' s way macarena joke, the appearing of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of north carolinian, and an all dorothy marching band perform " ended the rainbow " at a gay man ' s march. the get at that place from hither, though, you have to give in to one of the most offensively overbear musical lashings of all fourth dimension. jude priest, is there a single present moment of silence in this moving picture show? even the dialogue get drown out. what a permissive waste.
