man, this was 1 wierd moving picture. similar to conspiracy theory in that information technology couldn ' t decide which genre it is. the first time of day is your standard stock foreigner dead ringer, which nicely created an eerie atmospheric state astir the ship. the last one half hour? this was when the manufacturer bollocks up the book out the airlock and just determine - " screw information technology, let ' s precisely pop everybody ". from then on - forget sci - fi. .. this movie becomes one c% horror. what very dissappointed me about this moving picture show was that information technology hear to scare you in entirely the untimely way. or else of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this moving picture just uses loud noises, sudden photographic camera shifts and brusk quick bursts of gore. .. .. oscitance. .. . everyone ' s seen information technology all before and knows when to have a bun in the oven information technology. the unmatched thing that be done well was the lead up to finding out about what hap to the former gang. there be skeletons lie around mangled and chat up, but what did this? and then finally after being painfully restored - the new crowd views the television. the act international relations and security network ' t too forged at all. .. .. considering what the actors had to work with anyhow, as there is no complex oregon interesting dialog to speak of. there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though, alike when the hull nigh the span of the outcome horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific object as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into distance. this movie could have be so much better. information technology had a good experient cast who deserved more than to work with. there was scarcely zilch raw here that any of us haven ' t seen before in aliens or hellraiser.
