i have never run across a human so in love with himself than george iv george lucas. with the overt succeeder of the three original star wars films, george lucas has become, not necessarily a filmmaker, but the point cheeze at a brobdingnagian toy troupe, with the phantom peril the new cartesian product on the shelve. but this toy dog was made for $ 115 1000000, but every kid need information technology, and, like all other expensive toys, falls asunder within an 60 minutes after playact with it. the cartesian product in doubt, principal wars episode unity: the phantom menace (jeez! ), be pure and simple: its astir the money, baby! no one in their right mind would produce such a debacle if they knew it wouldn ' t make a gross ton of money before it fourth week of release. ane come to the sw enfranchisement as a alien, since ace have perfectly no approximation why the sw movies are so pop. 1 find them rather boring and full of nothing but centre candy. phantom menace is comparable the maiden sw, minus 10. nothing in the unanimous concept is remotely enjoyable. even the special effect appear rather bland. the tale in this new single is a fatuous deal. .. the dissemble wooden. .. and the activity sequences like something out of a telecasting game. sw: phantom threat is one of the worst films of the year so far. with a deed of conveyance like sw e1: tpm, george lucas has one big head on those shoulder. iodine thought chris carter act for releasing an ten - files movie, although, that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend deuce hours. pm is one foresighted headache.
