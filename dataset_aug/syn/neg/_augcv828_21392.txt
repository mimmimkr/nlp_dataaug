that is, unless you ' re ane of those people who get seen the prevue a thousand times on tv oregon in the theatre. unity can say you i thing now: they gave the entire movie away. wherefore someone would need to base an entire movie on peerless assumption and then give that of the essence detail away in the trailers is beyond me. nevertheless, if they * hadn ' t * give it away, the film would ' ve still cost suprisingly devoid of suspense given its open subject. obviously, the producer think they could remake " the deep end of the sea, " throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an activeness dramatic play. " double jeopardy " fling solid play from ashley judd and tommy lee jones, who got first billing even though he didn ' t see to be on screen one half every bit much as judd do. information technology too offers some really funny, clever, operating theater good - of - tension moments (my favorite: judd wake upwardly in the coffin ), but none of that can save the pic from its insanely predictable plot. one half the time i ' m wondering whether iodine ' m keep an eye on one of those overhyped tv miniseries, which always change state out to comprise to a lesser extent exciting than advertised. judgment by the beginning, conclusion, and a huge chunk of the midriff, iodin mightiness get equal watching a special hallmark presentation too. the movie ' sulphur stretching for an almost deuce hour long film with only xxx hour worth of material. implausible material, no lupus erythematosus. informal interpretation of single of the amendment away, too many sentence in the movie i think, " that is * not * possible *. " that kind of stuff and nonsense is excusable in popcorn flick, but not one like " threefold jeopardy " that test to pass itself off as good dramatic event. everything seems dragged out, ham it up. when they should ' ve kept u.s. in the dark, they let the qat out of the pocketbook also betimes.
