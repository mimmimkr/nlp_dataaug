claire danes, giovanni ribisi, and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists, but they ' re just about the only toothsome element of the mod police squad, a lame - brained big - screen version of the 70s television show. the story has all the originality of a block of ellen price wood (well, it would if you could decipher it ), the persona are all blank slates, and scott silver ' s perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come. by sheer force of talent, the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they ' re on screen, but the mod squad is just a second - charge per unit action picture with a first - rate cast.
