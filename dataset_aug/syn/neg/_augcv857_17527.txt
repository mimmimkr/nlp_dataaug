claire danes, giovanni ribisi, and omar epps make a likeable trio of protagonists, but they ' re just about the only toothsome element of the mod police squad, a lame - brained big - screen version of the seventy television display. the story has all the originality of a occlusion of wood (easily, it would if you could decipher it ), the persona be all blank slates, and scott silver ' s cursory action at law sequences are as cliched as they hail. by sheer force of talent, the three actors distort marginal use from the proceedings whenever they ' re on screen, but the mod team equal just a second - rate action painting with a foremost - rate stamp.
