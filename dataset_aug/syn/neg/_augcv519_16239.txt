terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute of arc photographic film adaption of james i jones ' world war two novel. unfortunately, atomic number 2 buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3 - hr long pseudo - epic poem. this is a shame because the motion picture show features an outstanding functioning by nick nolte. the best scene embody when nick nolte ' s eccentric, lt. col. tall, be forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt. staros (elias koteas) to execute an ordination. nolte ' s reaction and transformation whitethorn equal the best work of his career. had terrence malick concentrated on the great performance of nolte and koteas every bit well as those by sean pennsylvania, woody harrelson, and john cusack, he could own made a truly great film. rather, malick saddled the film with plodding pacing, unnecessary flashback, and a vocalism - concluded narration all design to telegraph the great philosophic underpinnings of the account. the narration was especially annoying as much of it vocalize same very bad high school day poesy. with a great deal of editing, the core story could be transformed into a truly classical warfare film. hopefully, the dvd version of this pic will feature choice to repress the narrative, and perhaps will even provide for an alternate, shorter version of the moving picture show. i render this film.
