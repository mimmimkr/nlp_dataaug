two company guy cable bob their headspring to haddaway ' s dance hit " what is make out? " while have themselves into trouble in club after nightclub. information technology ' s barely enough to affirm a three - minute _saturday_night_live_ skit, but _snl_ producer lorne michaels, _clueless_ creator amy heckerling, and paramount pictures saw something in the former night television institution ' s recur " roxbury guys " sketch that would presumably make a good feature. emphasis on the word of god " presumably. " _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already - flimsy concept and tediously stretchability information technology far beyond the break point - - and that of tv audience ' forbearance levels. the first five minutes or and then of _roxbury_ play real much like unity of the original " roxbury guys " skit. with " what is screw? " blaring on the soundtrack, the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi (chris kattan and testament ferrell) tail their heads, scope out " hotties " at club, and then bump a quality few with violent pelvic thrusts. there is unity crucial divergence, however - - these hombre speak. that small fact get comprise used as justification for the film ' s existence, that the butabis ' newfound capacity for speech communication would unfold upward a unanimous new set of doors for the fiber. the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriter steve koren, ferrell, and kattan equal young, that ' s for indisputable, merely they all lead to risible dead ends. there follow no story per southeast, alone a loosely structured and linked series of subplots. the brothers literally run into (or, preferably, get prevail into, as in by car) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ celebrity, and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury clubhouse. in that respect, they meet a hotshot club owner (chazz palminteri, conspicuously uncredited - - can you blame him? ), world health organization engage an interest in an estimate of theirs. meanwhile, the bros ' overbear church father (dan hedaya) wants them to hold on clubbing. when doug food waste and the dimwitted steve obeys his father, a breach is created between the two. the narrative mess of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that go on personify the slightest bit funny, but virtually none of information technology is. the assembled pressure consultation mostly sat stonily silent throughout the intact film, with the one big exception being a crowing laugh approximate the end. alas, the joke - - a kinda lazy sendup on _jerry_maguire_ - - will only come to a chord with hoi polloi who birth seen that celluloid. granted, a circle of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_, but the fact that the film ' s good joke is altogether subject on one ' s impropriety with another film enjoin a pile about _roxbury_ ' s lack of inspiration. that lack of inspiration dismiss constitute traced back to the insipid quality themselves. like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_, " the roxbury guy rope " is a one - joke resume that never once suggest that the characters have enough comic lifespan in them to survive extraneous of the sketch context. after watching one of the " roxbury " skits on snl, this is what you come away with from the character: they bob their heads to " what be fuck? ", bump unsuspecting women, and. .. that ' s all. after watch over _a_night_at_the_roxbury_, you ' ll be result with precisely the like.
