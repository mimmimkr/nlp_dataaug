what hath kevin williamson wrought? while the revulsion movie revival spur on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the musical genre - - _i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_, _halloween: _h20_, and _scream_2_ - - information technology mustiness be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films. those williamson - less situation - _scream_ efforts, among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_, have been frightening all mightily - - frighteningly, insultingly _bad_. add to that inclination _urban_legend_, which take a promising premiss and runs it through with a predictable meat grinder of idiocy. the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio victor horta is clear in two central arena. foremost, the opening sequence, corresponding that of _scream_, is an lengthy set objet d'art detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial clump pealing. this sequence, in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini (natasha gregson otto wagner) follow decapitated while labour, also reveals the former patently williamson - esque touch: the killer ' s look. crop in a large hooded windcheater, handle an ax, the killer digest more than than a passing resemblance to the _i_know. .. _fisherman, sans the bait. i thing horta does not take up from williamson, however, is the challenging premise. students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legend - - those modern day bit of " mythology " passed from someone to soul, group to group, yr to year that become indeed embedded in the social cognisance. it barely matters if they are honest or not, such as the magniloquent tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combining of pop rock and roll and pepsi (helium didn ' t ). michelle, slain by the " sea wolf lurking in the backseat " of lore, is simply the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true; as the torso count rises, fellow pendleton student natalie (alicia witt) suspects not only a link between the murders, but a personal connexion to her yesteryear as well. the setup show hope, but the story never takes off, due in large part to horta and the director, the aptly named jamie blank, who fires round of drinks afer round of his namesake in damage of suspense and scares. too many of the would - be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues, and the film ' s chase scenes be riddle with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert, like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should - - and could - - run out the front room access. but that is just the tip of the iceberg lettuce when it comes to cliches; thither ' s also the climactic villain confession, in which a contrived and way - as well - convenient motive is revealed, not to mention the credit card open up the locked door trick, which is a cliche in any movie genre. banks and horta ' atomic number 16 (intentional) attempt at humor are also lame; the fact that the best gags be lazy, in - jokey book of facts to the other credits of carbon monoxide - sensation joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot astir the mental imagery of their humor. some laughs are also accept when the instead predictable identity of the killer is revealed, but iodine ' molar concentration not thus sure if some of the more uproarious things about it follow think to be so. the filmmakers assume ' t get much help from their onscreen talent. iodin be far from a devotee of bland _i_know. .. _ starlet jennifer love hewitt, simply i ' d talke her any twenty four hours ove the dismally stiff and uncharismatic witt, whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laugh; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence - challenged star man, jared leto. _dawson ' s_creek_ wiz jackson mug his way thorugh a glorified cameo; gayheart displays entirely the depth and reach of, substantially, a noxzema spokeswoman; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor. granted, the cast constitute strangle by their cloth. loretta devine, who has done some fine body of work in pic such as _waiting_to_exhale_, comprise saddle with the ridiculous role of a pam grier - revere campus security guard. the recently resuscitate repugnance genre cannot rely on the campaign one man - - viz., kevin williamson - - to stay animated. if other film producer continue to make such tawdry intersection as _urban_legend_, the writing style looks to once again go the way of life of screen slashers ' many victims.
