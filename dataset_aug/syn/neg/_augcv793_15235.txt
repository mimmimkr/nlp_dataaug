this be the bad movie i ' ve viewed thus far in 98. the avenger = silly = piece preen in a derby hat hat + woman tire pissed leathers> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear courtship + greater evil, sir aug de wynter wearing kilt. the question is what could stimulate live on improper with a potentially great mind with big name cast of characters? the same head was probably asked of last year ' atomic number 16 stinker batman and robin. i feel the product got a minuscule too smug, the script a lilliputian to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collide unitedly to form a flick. my greatest critique rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed (thurman and fiennes )? something that was a vital ingredient of the 60 ' s boob tube serial of the same name. the dialog goes on and on astir tea and other finer british perks, but does non allow much room for character development and fundamental interaction, except to perhaps eat into on the viewer ' s nerves. one question why the dynamic pair fuss kissing in the ending except for pure english formality. connery as sir aug, does not fair better than thurman or fiennes. his dialogue is as erratic as stormy atmospheric condition, for the most part embarrassing and pathetic timber. if thither is a movie you would choose never to control, i believe the retaliator would be a good choice. for one thing, you will not make to witness a product that personify far inferior to the iii high visibility epithet that is associated with the title. i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could bear been released, just i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature, comparable lightning you can ' t picture information technology coming until it hits you.
