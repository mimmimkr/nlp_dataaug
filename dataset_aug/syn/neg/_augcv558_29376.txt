abstract: lifelong friends rafe (affleck) and danny (hartnett) unite the u.s. air force and are post at off white harbor, hawaii. rafe give up the ghost to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly stamp out in action. danny falls in love with rafe ' s girl, evelyn (beckinsale ), only rafe survives and comeback to confront his previous friend. in the meantime, the nipponese stealthy attack is imminent. .. review: " ivory seaport " is a staring illustration of movies as product rather than as art. information technology is little more than a crassly - calculated endeavour to woo the masses, lure them with braggy principal, full grown effects, and a enceinte setting - - only no heart. it is unmanageable to knock the doer, because they do everything the movie demand of them. deplorably, this amounts to barely more than recite talks of such sheer platitude that it gain one tidal bore to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing " drop harbor " with his left. the plot here is staring commonplace, and the wartime congeal simply a convenient backdrop. on that point be no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the joined dos, and no insight into its vital persona in inciting that rural area to join reality war ii. instead, there is just an assembly - line love triangle, some empty bellied loyal rhetoric, and a idiotic attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders (when one intones, " i fear all we have done cost to awaken a sleeping giant ", i nearly fall taboo of my seat ). to the movie ' s credit, information technology does include a tremendous delineation of the attack itself, an exciting and dizzy hour which plunges viewer into the warfare. if only the remain 2 hours stimulate been crafted with such skill, perhaps this memorial day non - event would have embody deserving observance.
