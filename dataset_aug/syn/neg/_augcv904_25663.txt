information technology ' s a good matter most animated sci - fi film come from japan, because " titan a. vitamin e. " is proof that hollywood doesn ' t have a clue how to do information technology. i don ' thymine know what this film be supposed to equal more or less. from what i can tell it ' s about a immature gentleman's gentleman call kale who ' s one of the last survivor of earth in the early thirty first century who unknowingly possesses the samara to saving and re - generating what is left of the human race. that ' s a okay assumption for an natural process - packed sci - fi animated pic, but in that respect ' s no payoff. the story take the primary quality all over the galaxy in their lookup for a fabled ship that the evil " dredge " disaffect need to destroy for no apparent rationality. so in the process we get a mess of spaceship fights, fistfights, blaster fights and to a greater extent duple - crosses than you can escape from a stick at. there ' sulphur so much pointless sci - fi give and take information technology ' s also much to take. the beetleweed here is a total rip - cancelled of the " star war " universe the maker don ' t bother fill in the basic details which take the story confusing, the characters unmotivated and superficial and the patch barely plain boring. despite the fantastic invigoration and special effects, it ' entropy just non an interesting movie.
