a couple of criminals (mario van peebles and loretta devine) move into a ample family ' s house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels. however, someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them. writer mario van peebles delivers a clever book with several unexpected plot twists, but director mario avant garde peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work, editing and step. it felt as though the film should get be wrapping up at the hour mark, but alas there was still thirty five more minutes to go. daniel baldwin (i can ' t believe i ' m about to type this) gives the best performance in the film, outshining the other talented fellow member of the cast.
