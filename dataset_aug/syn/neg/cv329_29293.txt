beware of movies with the music director ' s name in the deed of conveyance. take " saint john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars " (please ). if the carpenter brand name wasn ' t superglued to the title, this embarrassment would surely have short circuit theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network. and i would have been spared a headache. the latest from the director of " starman, " " halloween " and " escape from new york " is a lousy western all gussied up to expect like a futuristic horror flick. the production is set on mars in 2176, where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world. six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet, terra - forming to make it more hospitable for future generation. a matriarchal society. terra - forming. sounds pretty intriguing, eh? well, don ' t get your hopes up.
