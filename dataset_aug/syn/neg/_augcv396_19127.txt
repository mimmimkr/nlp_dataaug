adam sandler international relations and security network ' t known for appearing in deep, thought - provoking photographic film, simply he ' s still a truly funny guy. most of his moving picture show are successful non because of the film making behind them, only because they let sandler do what he do best without a stupid plot to overwhelm him prohibited. big dad is the first motion picture show in which the story seems more important than sandler ' s comic performance, and information technology ' s a suffering nonstarter. sandler plays a thirty - something loser world health organization catch attached to an orphan unseasoned boy (played by cole and bob dylan sprouse ). as one might require from the synopsis, director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences, include a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters read " good - bye " to one another; in add on, there ' s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet bodily fluid (urine and vomit both catch more screen time than sandler himself ). there ' s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who antecedently worked at hooters, and the moving picture features passable performances from sandler, joey lauren adams (as the love interest ), and the two young boys, but the movie on the whole is stock and disappointingly unfunny.
