stallone attempts to ' number ' in this cop dramatic event. the pic is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal, world health organization ' s nephew (played by michael rappaport) is involve in a car crash and cleanup of ii black market youths. keital dosen ' tetraiodothyronine real want to receive involved in anything, gets rid of rappaport, and stallone and de niro seek to work out what the hell on earth is go on. this film should cost brilliant. it sounds like a great plot, the actors are first level, and the supporting cast is upright aswell, and stallone be assay to deliver a good carrying into action. however, information technology can ' t agree up. although the playacting is wild (even stallone isn ' t bad) the directing and story be dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long, with nothing really happen in them. in fact, the only scenes that do piece of work exist action scenes, which i suspect stallone was assay to ward off. in this film, good mean dull. the dialogue be yodel, and fundamentally merely repeats the same points over and over, no issue who equal delivering them. the plot, which have potential difference, is wasted, once more hardly being cliched after a while. in fact, the solitary matter that does hold the celluloid going is kietal and de niro, both delivering their usual full performance. however, stallone, although non give much to suppose, gives a good performance. nevertheless, it ' s not entirely that bad. as said above, the action scene are well do. theres likewise a very good ending, which uses the cinemas sound organisation good. in fact, the last 10 minutes of this 2 hr film represent one of the best endings of 1997. if just the rest of the moving picture was as good as the terminate. cop land, and so, turns out not to be a power theater film, merely a kind of dull, and non every exciting film. enormously disappointing, and iodin can ' t truly recommend it.
