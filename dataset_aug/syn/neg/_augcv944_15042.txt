" it was non scarey. " these constitute the initiatory words that came to mind after it was over. when a movie is called _vampires_, " not shuddery " aren ' t words that should make up associated with it. but that wasn ' t my lonesome gripe. john carpenter is a name associated with cutting - bound movie house, as in the vivid panic attack of _halloween_, _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_, or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_. unfortunately, the lonesome affair that be cut edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to progress to. with an anaemic plot of ground and not - quite an - kosher special personal effects, _john carpenter ' s vampires_ has barely enough substance to quench the thirst of even the least discerning genre buff. the film is at first worry with a group of roam vampire slayer, lead by james wood, of all people. like some sorting of holy a - team (they yet take their ain souped - up vanguard ), the bunch invade and rub tabu a nest of vampires in a novel mexico shack. their method acting be amusingly innovative: the blood - mark are reeled out with harpoon so they potty flame up in the sun like matchsticks. to remember their victory, the neanderthal band decorates a motel elbow room with fighting joe hooker and party the night aside. their celebration equal unforesightful - lived, however, as a skipper vampire named valek ambushes and unmarried - handedly destroys most of the squad. woods ' jack corvus and brother montoya (daniel stanley baldwin) escape with their life, along with a cleaning lady named katrina (sheryl lee ). although the woman has be bitten, montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychical tie to the lord lamia. the rest period of the movie is refer with the boy ' hunt for valek (thomas ian david lewelyn wark griffith ), a freaky marilyn manson - type world health organization ' s on a mission that dates backwards 600 years. along the elbow room they foot up a priest list guiteau (tim guinee ), a character who assist pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl. upham in _saving private ryan_. some stuff come about in the heart of the movie, only i can ' t remember most of it, because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the physique more interesting than what equal happening on screen. _vampires_ finally bulge to pick upwards about 90 proceedings into the mix, as line shooting, guiteau, and montoya assault an abandoned prison - turned vampire nest. only then does the film begin to yet resemble a carpenter film. but information technology ' s too little too late. we get the inevitable final confrontation, only it seems tacked on and sort of anti - climactic (follow on, we ' re trade with _the_ master vampire hither! ) interestingly, last summer ' s vampire actioner _blade_ was derive from a comic book, and _vampires_ from a novel, nevertheless the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the late, a more careful superhero flick. woods ' jack corvus spouts glib turned - the - handlock one - lining and promenade away from exploding building with that oh - thence - cool footstep. and his motive for toss off vampires? take a raving mad guess. ( hint: a ______ killed his _____ when atomic number 2 was but a _____. ) at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness. _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrill to mask information technology gossamer - thin plot. to make up for this, the movie resorts to other " shock, " such as its mostly patronise attitude towards women (crow slaps them around for the fun of it) and an overplayed contempt for religion (crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to " getting woodies. " ) information technology can be argued that maybe i want too much from this movie. if non scary and gory, i wanted tense, relentless, and tucker. _john carpenter ' s vampires_ is none of these. i put up only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan. for the rest of you face for a good panic, beware: _vampires_ live a film with no teeth.
