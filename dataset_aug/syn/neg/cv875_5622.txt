everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no accomplishment in setting up an exciting action sequence. billy zane be wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is given very little to do, and does very little with it. treat williams, looking like rhett butler but vocalise like mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have ever understand in a movie. only catherine zeta john paul jones, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance. she has energy and spunk, which the movie needed very much more of. oh yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity only this is so poorly played out you won ' t still care. about the only things i can recommend be a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if youre looking for a fun family movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is not a good movie.
