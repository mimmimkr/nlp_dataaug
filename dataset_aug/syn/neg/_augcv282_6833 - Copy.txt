the assumption of sturm und drang is ane ' m sure very familiar to us all. we ' ve go through information technology before in rider 57, executive decision, and countless other flicks that are good in in that location ain mode. you know, terrorist take over a plane, ask the police force on the ground for what they what and thusly on. turbulence starts away with a " convict " ray liotta being impeach of a crime. you think thither is no manner helium could have done information technology, he ' s so open and kind. he be taken in and is later on transported on a commerical plane to la. this make up already a problem. there is no path that convicts would be ship on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on. anyway, it is christmas eventide and everyone is waiting to fuck off to la and spend christmastide eve there. well, convict unmatched grapple to stop the flight in information technology proverbial " tracks " and liotta, still as calm as ever, bring the early convict out. atomic number 2 also has eyes for lauren holly, a escape attendent, and seems to grow close to her. " the secret plan stops here " ane didn ' thyroxin like this movie because it seemed to be a rip turned of every other airplane movie atomic number 53 ' ve always envision. at one point, mr. liotta look exactly similar jack tar nicholson in the shining (1 ' m serious! ). it was comparable they stole for every other movie mastered to a " triiodothyronine ". the lone reason one did not give this cipher hotshot is because it had some okay stunt. don ' t still bother!
