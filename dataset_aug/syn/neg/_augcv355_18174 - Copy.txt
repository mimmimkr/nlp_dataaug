bob the felicitous bastard ' s quickie limited review: the odd couple deuce grumpy old men, information technology ain ' triiodothyronine. hell, my fellow american, information technology ain ' t. walter matthau and squat lemmon squad up again for an even more worn out fomite than any of their motion picture show ended the past few years. odd couple ii feels terribly generic, where in the maiden flick, made xxx one year ago, feel comparable a wonderful tale. that ' s like repackaging joseph campbell ' s soup in a generic food rump, really. how writer neil simon could ' ve made such a horrible fault in screen piece of writing exist beyond me. throughout the moving picture show, i in truth didn ' t jape once. candidly. i mean, thither embody dumb situations, yeah, same the cropduster who lease these one time geezers let it without any observance, but they but really didn ' t seem funny to me. and that car rolling off the drop off? the only way atomic number 53 would ' ve seen humor in that is if they make up still in it. and the ending get all tops - mushy, too. in the terminal twenty minutes or therefore, lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the ace, then fall behind her; matthau public lecture to his son (a wasted jonathan silverman) about his amrriage to lemmon ' s daughter; and, of course, lemmon and matthau receive another roomie situation on their hands. ooh, i actually gave a spate forth thither, i ' m sure. believe it a hospitable gester, you advance ' t waste your time renting this goop.
