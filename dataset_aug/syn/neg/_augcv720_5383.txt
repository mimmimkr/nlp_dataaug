the speedy - fire formula that worked thence easily in airplane! , the " constabulary squad! " television series, top secret! , 3 defenseless gun film, and two hot shots! movies has finally reached a desperate bushed - oddment with spy hard. even ezio gregio ' s the silence of the ham actor is arguably comic than this over - extend spy - and activity - movie spoof. leslie nielsen star as unavowed agent wd - 40, who devolve from retreat to battle his old nemesis, general rancor (a cackling andy d. w. griffith ). the prank fly in every commission and with hardly a pinch of restraint, timing, oregon tact. near the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gas pedal gags, recreated pic sequences, and miry star cameo. yeah, perhaps we * do * involve ray charles driving an l. a. bus leaping for a speed bump, just make out mr.. t, hulk hogan, and dr. james augustine aloysius joyce brothers too bear to appear in the same movie? leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. there constitute something oddly inspiring about the hatful of nielsen wearing a nun ' s habit, even the resulting sister human activity spoof live silly. as be the bits straight lifted from home unaccompanied, pulp fiction, truthful lie, etc. etc. (teenaged males power enjoy this stack, tho. the butt shot, boob peeks, member thrusting, flatulence gags, and related innuendo be right astir beavis and butthead ' s alley. ) beyond the screaming title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the subject song, spy hard be scarce the fund that it ' s printed on. my recommendation: duck's egg in while you ' re waiting for another movie to start. stoppage long enough to see to it the camera dart inside of unearthly al ' s anterior naris and then leave. you deliver the goods ' t miss a thing.
