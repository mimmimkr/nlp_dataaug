if the seventy ' s nostalgia didn ' t make you feel old, the 80 ' s nostalgia cost bind to. one of the latter set, " the wedding ceremony singer, " seems to be written by someone world health organization did not experience the 1980 ' s directly but just read astir them in an clause in parade magazine. the haywire fashions are here. . . and the medicine. . . and reference aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times, but it all seem tediously - and besides apparently - inclose for the didn ' t - we - garb - funny - backward - so chuckle. the plot be stock romantic comedy with nothing original: robbie (adam sandler) represent a wedding vocalizer; julia (drew barrymore) waits tabular array at weddings. both are engaged; still, robbie ' s fiance (angela featherstone) dumps him at the lord's table, and julia ' s fiance (matthew glave) be a skirt - chasing plunger in junk bonds. robbie and julia conk through the carry ups - and - downs as they realize they cost imply to be together. i ' ll fess up - i ' ve ne'er found adam sandler good story. whatever his appeal is, unity ' ve missed information technology. ( other comedian i don ' t get include pauly shore and pee wee herman - make your ain judgments ). the stupidity and artificiality of the whole labor is sum up in a cameo by billy idol as himself. idol looks like hell, and the ravage of his modus vivendi are barely concealed by duncish make up. helium ' s mocked by a photo of his younger ego on a rolling stone screening in the same panorama. we ' re not supposed to notice that, and we ' re not opine to notice how light headed it be that billy idol suddenly seem to play fairy godmother to robbie. other cameo, by steve buscemi and jon lovitz, bring home the bacon the lone real laugh in the movie. lovitz is specially well, playing a rival marriage singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to exact advantage of robbie ' s post - break of serve - improving low.
