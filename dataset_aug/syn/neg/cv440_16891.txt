the comet - disaster flick is a disaster alright. directed by tony scott (top gun ), it tells the story about an asteroid the size of it of texas caught on a collision course with earth. and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble. jeez. after a great opening, in which an american spaceship, plus the city of new york, are completely destroyed by a comet shower, nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy. they hire the world ' s good oil driller (bruce willis ), and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem. that ' s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier, isn ' t it? the action in armageddon are so over the top, nonstop, and too ludicrous for words, i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a pair of times. i was not alone. plus, to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor ' s talents. the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots. the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out - perform deep impact. producer jerry bruckheimer bomb with armageddon.
