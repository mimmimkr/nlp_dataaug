don ' t permit this film fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakspere. no one will truly see the heart and soul of this humans except done his study, and this movie makes a vain attempt at that. any moves to? glamorise ' his life, which hollywood has an annoying leaning to cause, will just subtract from his accomplishment kinda than exposit on his greatness. this movie astir his life, although considerably write, puts to a fault much shuffle - up on a man whose life was probably more than pork and murphy, rather than lobster and champagne. oh well, let ' s fantasise onwards an assume that he follow a bit of a flirtatious period of play - write, world health organization falls in love with a beautiful woman (gwyneth paltrow) and from her brainchild, several plays develop -? romeo and juliet ', and? the duodecimal night '. information technology be easier for me to think that he had a wet dream and that ' s how all his plays develop, but please dispense with maine all of this unnecessary melodrama. but i hypothesis my version probably wouldn ' t draw a crowd operating theater make a one dollar bill on screen. then is there any justification in romanticising the human race shakespeare, when all we call for to dress be take his work in order to find his soul. i retrieve not. as for the oscars were they deserve by this film? one think not. in many aspects? private ryan ' and? life is beautiful ' be far superior movies, but one should never assume that this should be a measure for winning an academy award, as time and again, for intellect unexplained, an undeserving movie leave win the accolade. another sore decimal point be the fact that gwyneth won the best distaff lead, over a more refined cate, merely i guess if you go on enough astir your grandfather demise and your nephew being hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you.
