supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge trench in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898. john patterson (val kilmer ), the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation, tried to rid his military operation of the lions, but fails. a world renound hunter, remington (michael douglas ), is called in and the battle, human race against lion, begins. this film has a great soundtrack, and wonderful scenery. the acting is not too sorry except the characters are all so thin. we only see one side of each character. kilmer is a bridge builder and that ' s all we see him as. these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn ' t even appear to be too upset about it. and the plot? information technology ' s jaws, but with lions. again we ' re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should. it appears to kill humans because it just likes too. why? who sleep together. i guess there wouldn ' t be much of a story if it didn ' t. the problem is that on that point isn ' t much of a story even though it does.
