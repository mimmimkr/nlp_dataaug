when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain, you live that you can expect nada more than a b grade activity picture. however, since this film also featured michael madsen, more than capable character role player, this meter in the function of champion, the author of this review decided to give the movie some benefit of the doubt. however, the very first scenes show clear vitamin b complex grade action mechanism credentials - madsen play richard montana, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life time low for local offense lord mario gio (played by lynch ). however, the raid be just partially successful, and montana personify getting the tap. and then, he start his own private warfare against gio, trying to penetrate his organisation simulation to be corrupt. in the process, helium meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora (played by rosie vela) and begin relationship with her too. although it doesn ' t stink like many of the similar film can, inside edge be mostly forgettable b level action mechanism routine. nobody in this film actually puts much cause, including madsen or lynch, and this is particularly case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen oregon director warren clarke. the only non then forgettable element in this moving picture is presence of former supermodel rosie vela, who, apart from read her more than telling looks, shows some of the singing natural endowment to a fault. however, this international relations and security network ' t reason enough for tv audience to spend hour and half watching a film that they would, in most likeliness, bury the next clarence day.
