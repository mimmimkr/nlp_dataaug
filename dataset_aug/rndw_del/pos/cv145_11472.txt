this remake of " la cage aux folles " features a gay couple pretending be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son ' s future in - laws. the couple (robin williams and nathan lane) are about as archetypal, or as the less kind might put it? , gays possible. williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured. they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode. williams is excellent as should be no surprise. gene hackman right - wing potential father - in - law is refreshing in one of his few comedic. the real star is lane. his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight - shooting uncle is hilarious. perhaps it is a personal failing my part, but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high just grates on nerves and the first few minutes of this film filled with it. luckily (for me at least ), it doesn ' t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men, their son and deception. the question of stereotypes is a touchy one. these guys personify the homophobic gay image. you can almost hear the swishing. if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world, you ' ll be outraged. but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals, you ' ll love it. your choice.
