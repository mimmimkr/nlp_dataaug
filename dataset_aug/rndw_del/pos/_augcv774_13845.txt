almost a full decade before steven spielberg ' s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro - soldier ", john irvin ' s hamburger hill proved it could. lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone ' s platoon, excellent film dismissed as " too militaristic ". it ' s hard to understand exactly - - - unless irvin, in assembling his motley collection of young men for predictable (and often naive) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle, - - - has refused present us the stone killer, drug - stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the, the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii movies. hamburger hill, based on a true story, is not an easy film to watch. there is a scene that will have graying anti - war activists squirming in their seats, or moved to genuine tears. and the climactic final assault on the " hill " in question is visually confusing. gristly realities are presented in brief flashes, if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered. and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee, veteran and " newbie ", black soldier and white, become almost indistinguishable from each other, as they do in the chaos of actual combat. the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney. vance as doc - - in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as " seaman jones " in mctiernan ' s red october. if you ' ve seen private ryan, you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill - - if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg ' s vision was as present in the valley as it was at omaha beach.
