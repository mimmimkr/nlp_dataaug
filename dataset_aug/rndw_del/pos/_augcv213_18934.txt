in one of my many videos i have attained from local library, casablanca was my third classic in some weeks. the others being citizen kane and vertigo (yes, i am trying to see as many of afi ' s greatest movies ever made as i can ). but, casablanca stood out from the rest for me: it actually watchable. what most hail as the greatest american film ever, isn ' t so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in. it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman. that annoyed me, as did the ending. why didn ' t the plan turn around? !? surprisingly, i enjoyed the film. i liked bogart ' s character and his acting (not over the top as most actors in his era ). i once read about if you had a choice to be in a, which one would it be, and a women said casablanca. at first i was thinking to myself " why? " then, as i watched film again, i understood why. movie is well done and the script top - notch, although i doubt i understood more than half of the political jumbo. is, in my mind, no classic (like solaris ), but it is a good film and stylishly shot. hey, hollywood, how about this: a remake with harrison ford and anne heche? now that would be a classic.
