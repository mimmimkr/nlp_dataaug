a sci fi / comedy starring jack nicholson, pierce brosnan, annette benning, glenn close, martin short and other stars. a warner bros picture the martians have landed in this tim burton movie. before entering the cinema, i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like. many people were that this film was silly rubbish, and there was no point to it all. how wrong they. i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the. the story is about martians attacking earth. using ray guns (hooray!) they generally cause havoc around the u. s and other countries. plays the president who must try to stop invasion, and also taking advice from his loopy officials. but, basically, its a load of set showing the martians destroying earth. the way people are killed by the ray guns is great, they a hillarous (and mildly disturbing scene) involving a martian lady, a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away, (and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding. but, most of all, this film is fun. the martians are full of character, the performances are spot on, and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable. the film is a million times better then dire independance day, and is a real tribute to the tacky ' 50s invasion movies. they are is a great score by danny elfman, and lots of laughs. this has be the best invasion ' ve seen for a long time.
