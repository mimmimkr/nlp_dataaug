usually a movie is about something more than a soiled, but not the big lebowski. the new offering from the creators of 1996 ' s critical hit fargo, is to say the least, wildly entertaining. originality has always been strong trait in the coen brother ' s movies, and the big lebowski insanely original. it begins oddly enough when jeff " the dude " lebowski (jeff bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire, jeff " the big " lebowski (david huddleston ), who ' s wife, bunny (tara) owes money all over town. two goons, out to collect on bunny ' s debt break into dude ' s house. attempt to collect the money that bunny owes and one of them urinates on his rug. the day dude explains his situation to his bowling team (steve buscemi & john goodman, respectively.) he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug. he does this, and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper. this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments. the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly. also several great supporting roles, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus. the coen ' s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it entertaining. i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo, but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998. if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one, if not they give this one a its little different.
