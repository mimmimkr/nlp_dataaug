a movie is about something more than a soiled rug, but not the big lebowski. the new offering from the creators of 1996 ' s critical hit fargo, is to say the least, wildly entertaining. originality has always been a strong trait in coen brother ' s movies, and the big lebowski is insanely original. it begins oddly enough when jeff " the dude " lebowski (jeff bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire, jeff " the big " lebowski (david huddleston ), who ' s wife, bunny (tara reid) owes money all over. two goons, out to collect on bunny ' s debt break into dude ' s house. they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug. the next day dude explains his situation to bowling team (steve buscemi & john goodman, respectively.) he is advised to go to the big lebowski and him to pay for the defiled rug. he does this, and shortly gets tied up in a kidnapping caper. this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments. the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly. several great supporting roles, john as a child molesting bowler named jesus. the coen ' s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make extremely entertaining. i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo, but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998. if you like anything else the brothers have done you will love this one, if not they give this one a try its a little different.
