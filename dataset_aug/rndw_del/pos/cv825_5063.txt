` strange days ' chronicles the last two of 1999 in los angeles. as the locals gear up for the new millenium, lenny (ralph fiennes) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips. he pines for his ex - girlfriend, faith (juliette lewis ), not noticing that another friend, mace (angela) really cares for him. this film features good performances, impressive film - making technique and breath - taking crowd scenes. director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it. but as a whole, this is an unsatisfying. the is that the, james cameron and jay cocks, were too ambitious, aiming for a film with social relevance, thrills, drama. that ambitious film - making should be discouraged; just that when it fails to its goals, it fails badly and obviously. the film just ends up, unexciting and uninvolving.
