i have seen several (but not that many) woody allen movies. i didn ' t particulary like radio days, the rose of cairo, play again, sam. i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything. .. sex, and i loved might aphrodite. however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore. and bullets got some very raving reviews, but i didn ' t think i ' d like. but i finally saw it (double feature with to wear i think) and hated it. since. .. i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn ' t sure if i ' d want to see. .. thankfully i did! people burst into singing and dancing, something i hardly ever like. but this movie is so infectious. and funny! and! (and unlike evita, they only when they need to.) sure some of the actors may be great singers, but they seems to be having a great time, and so does the audience. that ' s all i have to say. really, if you think that is going to be a dull movie, you ' re probably dead. and dead people not forced into movie theatres. is mark dead? he said that " this is an almost misfire ". the movie is rated r, for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * *.
