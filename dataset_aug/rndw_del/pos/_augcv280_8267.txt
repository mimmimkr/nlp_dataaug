this three movie up with a view of singer / guitar player / musician / composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members. all the displays compilation of footage, mostly from the concert at the palladium new york city, halloween. other footage shows backstage foolishness, and amazing clay animation by bruce. the performance of " titties and beer " played in this movie is very entertaining, with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil. frank ' guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i ' ve ever heard. bruce bickford ' s outlandish clay animation is that belief with zooms, morphings, etc. and, it doesn ' t even look like clay, it looks like meat.
