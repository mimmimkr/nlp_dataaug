synopsis: leonard shelby (pearce) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife. leonard has only a few clues to the murderer ' s identity; to make matters worse, he suffers from a condition which the creation of short - term memories, meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier. because of this, leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself. " memento " traces the investigation back in time from its culmination. review: " memento " is the sort of movie i wish i ' d written; i can think of no praise than that. i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant, involved, original movie as this. an instant film noir classic, " memento " virtually flawless. the script is unlike any i have ever seen - - a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity. although the idea of starting at the " conclusion " of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the " start " not entirely new, never before i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence. " memento " is endlessly exciting and inventive, a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself, and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre. and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively. nolan ' s direction is equally effective, never losing its crispness clarity despite " memento " ' s challenging gimmick. and to top everything off, all the performances rise to the occasion. pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard; shows great as enigmatic natalie; and pantoliano ' s teddy achieves a splendidly yet sinister quality. " memento " may be the year ' s best screenplay, and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001.
