schwimmer (from the television series " friends ") stars as a sensitive (and slightly neurotic) single who gets more than he expected the grieving mother (barbara hershey) of a classmate he can ' t remember. hello. robinson! though quite cute as a romantic comedy, the paced like a funeral march. the characters act, react, and interact at half - speed, making for one * excruciatingly * long sit. (and what ' s with the dreary?) co - writer / director matt reeves brings some snap to story ' s midsection; the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for * another * classmate (a appealing gwyneth paltrow ). by this time, though, most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep. those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy - eyed schwimmer, a hound dog with a head cold, who can go for an hour without ever changing his expression.
