i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year, when matthew perry had just signed on. i ' m big fan of perry ' s subtle sense of humor, and in addition, think chris farley ' s on - edge, extreme acting was riot. so naturally, when the for " almost heroes " hit theaters, i almost jumped and down. a soda in hand, the lights dimming, i was ready to be blown away by farley ' s final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry ' s big breakthrough. was ready to be just amazed; for this to be among farley ' s best, in spite of david spade ' s absence. i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute credits ran. sadly, none of this came to pass. the humor is spotty at best, with moments and laughable one - liners few and far between. perry and farley have no chemistry; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade, for it ' s his type of humor, and not at all what perry associated with. and the movie tries to be smart, a subject best left alone when it ' s a farley flick. the movie is a major dissapointment, with only a few scenes worth a first look, let alone a second. perry delivers not one humorous line the movie, and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley. and farley ' s classic humor is widespread, too. almost heroes almost works, but misses the wagon - train by quite a longshot. guys, let ' s leave the exploring to lewis and clark, huh? stick to " tommy boy ", we ' ll all be " friends ".
