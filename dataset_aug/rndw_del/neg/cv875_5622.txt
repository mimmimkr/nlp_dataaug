everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no in setting exciting action sequence. billy zane is wooden the hero. kristy swanson is given very little to do, and does little with it. treat williams, looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie. only zeta, one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance. she has energy and spunk, which the movie needed much more of. oh yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won ' t even care. about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if looking for a fun family movie, watch the underrated flipper. this is not a good movie.
