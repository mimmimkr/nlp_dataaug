die hard 2 an altogether unfortunate fiasco, inferior to the original in every respect. place the squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson, who wrote the film ' s pathetic screenplay. every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor. the plot is altogether implausible; the convoluted story line involves a band terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower, a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land. the film has zero credibility, and all of the characters come off as cliched, cardboard cut - outs. so much the script. about the action? well, let ' s put it this way: director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan, who directed the original, as well as the hunt for red october and predator - - all standouts for their hair - raising suspense. by contrast, harlin doesn ' t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action, consequently, die hard 2 never picks up steam. die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute. in fact, the movie often seems deliberately campy, and it almost reaches the threshold so bad it ' s good. you do, but you laugh at the film, not with it. die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff.
