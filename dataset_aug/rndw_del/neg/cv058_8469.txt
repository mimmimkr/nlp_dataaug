of course i knew this going in. why is it that whenever a tv - star makes a movie ' s always romantic comedy, and they say on entertainment tonight or something, that were " attracted to the characters. they were really original. " original? ! let me give you a run - through of picture perfect: character a) kate (jennifer aniston, from tv ' s friends ), a smart, beautiful, professional woman wants two things she can ' t have: a new job - and the love of her co - worker kevin bacon. her boss will only give the job if she gets married and a mortgage gets a lease on a german sportscar, and kevin pnly sleeps with married or involved girls. what does she do? she invents a fiance! then when everyone wants to meet him, she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner, and pick a fight with her at the end, thus breaking the engagement but still being able keep her job, since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor, defenceless female. he, of course, goes along with it. gee, i wonder if they get together in the end. i ' ve seen more original stuff on the wb. and better stuff too. picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes, and expecting us to like aniston ' s character, who comes off as a cold, spoiled bitch.
