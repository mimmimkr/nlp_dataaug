" american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer ' s attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple - ness and zany comedy. it ' s about an a + student (biggs as " paul ") who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora (suvari) a ditzy heroin - chic goth chick who has no ambition or self - respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick - boy " paul is. so we ' ve got a fish - out - water formula mixed with meet - cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie. the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by " " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything the film. these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it ' s as if everyone under 30 is a stoned raver. there ' s no background or details to anyone or anything, it ' s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other. not to mention the story itself which virtually non - existant contains so many plotholes it ' s like swiss cheese. even the editing is bad. if you ' re looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny. i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night audience barely laughed at all. if you ' ve seen the commericials you ' ve seen the " funny " parts (which are all from the first five minutes ).
