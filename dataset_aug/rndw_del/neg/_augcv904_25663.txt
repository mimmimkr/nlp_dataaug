it ' s a good thing most animated sci - fi movies come from japan, because " titan a. e. " is proof that hollywood doesn ' t have a clue how to do it. i don ' t know what this film is supposed to be about. from what i can tell it ' s about a young man kale who ' s one the last survivors earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re - generating what is left of the human race. that ' s a fine premise for an action - packed sci - fi animated movie, but there ' s no payoff. the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in search for a legendary ship that the evil " dredge " aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason. so the process we get a lot of spaceship fights, fistfights, blaster and more double - crosses than you can shake a stick at. there ' s so much pointless sci - fi banter it ' s too much take. the galaxy here is a total rip - off of the " star wars " universe the creators don ' t bother filling in basic details which makes the story confusing, the characters unmotivated and and the plot just plain boring. despite the animation and special effects, it ' s just not an interesting movie.
