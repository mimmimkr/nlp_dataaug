" shagadellic! ", " groovy, baby! " " smashing! " adorn the 1 / 4 page ad for this movie tabbed as " the # 1 comedy in america " as of may 8th. did we attend the same movie? ! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong, like a snl skit on steroids, and at any length it seemed unfunny. yes, the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills, and yes, the concept, dealing with a 60s secret agent / pop icon (played by myers) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to his arch enemy (. evil, also played myers) in the present day, had a great deal of potential. fun scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor. don ' t get me wrong, i like a good " bubbles in the bathtub " as much as the next person, but to have this type humor be the funniest thing your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money. but, the way things work these days in the movie business, all a film has to do is call itself the funniest people will believe it. i do give this film because of the sets, costumes, and sadly, unmet potential.
