yet another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs and. stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn ' t look more bored. characters are cardboard cut - outs of every cliched teenager there. one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie. everything about it annoyed the hell out of me. the acting, and script, the plot, and. the director (of the fluke hit swingers) could have well directed a of no - name actors had a watchabe film. the " big " stars of go pretty much drown project of any originality. i felt like i was watching dawson ' s creek episode 200. although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast. the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable. since when is a male character ' s sudden outing of closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore? ? go is dawson ' s creek + varsity blues - she ' s that = go home and watch something else.
