in the phantom you have seen many before and there is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence. zane is wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is given very little to do, and does very little with it. williams, looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have seen in a movie. only catherine zeta jones, as of williams cohorts turns in a good performance. she has energy and spunk, which the movie needed much more of. oh yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this played out you won ' t even care. about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if youre looking for a fun movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is not a good movie.
