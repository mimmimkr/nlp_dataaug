in this re - make the 1954 japanese monster film, godzilla is transformed a " jurassic park " copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town. although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while, it gets old. the film often makes no sense (a several - hundred tall beast hides in subway tunnels ), second - rate effects (the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ), lame jokes (mayor ebert and his assistant gene are funny ), horrendous acting (even matthew broderick is dull) and unbelievable love story (why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo ' s character? ). there are other elements of the film that fall, but going on would just be a waste of good words. only for die - hard creature feature fans, this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door. i couldn ' t. (michael redman has written this column for 23 and seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both " fear and loathing " and " godzilla " in the same evening. )
