a big, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch, the white hype stars samuel l. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay - per - view revenues is to " invent " a white contender (peter berg) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " (damon wayans ). (the logic is that will pay more to see black vs. white than black vs. black.) he may be, in an absurdly accurate way, but the film doesn ' t give us a reason to care. as a scathing sports spoof, hype is just: unfunny, unfocused, and, at times, just plain pointless. as a commentary on race relations, it ' s even * less * effective. the dialogue is the best of mess, lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs! " writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang, though we never hear enough of it. the script ' t strong enough, though, to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin (party ). he comes across absolute overkill. the great white hype * almost * turns around at end, at the big match, when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock - concert proportions. with costumed dwarfs, gangsta rappers, and " champ " dressed as death, only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should ' ve been.
