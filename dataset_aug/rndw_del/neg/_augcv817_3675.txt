we ' re back in blade runner territory with this one, conceptual artist robert longo ' s vision a william gibson - inspired where information is the commodity to kill for. front and center is johnny (keanu reeves ), a " - courier " who smuggles data via a " wet - wired " implant. he ' s ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long - term memory restored, but, first, he has to finish one last, dangerous job. . the pressing problem in mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten to play an action hero since his stint on speed. he ' s walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins, ice - t, and dina meyer. (dolph lundgren ' s street preacher is in an acting category all its own. : -) without a believable performance between them, all we can do is back and the atmosphere, which is pretty good in places. the vr sequences are way cool, but the physical fx - - such as miniatures and mattes - - leave a lot to be desired. watch out for those bad blue - screens! we wouldn ' t a of mnemonic if the action played better. too bad the debut director isn ' t very strong in this de - partment. his big finale is a sloppy, silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long, which is way past the time that most of our " wet - wired " processors have already shut down. bottom line: yatf (yet another tortured future ). skip it.
