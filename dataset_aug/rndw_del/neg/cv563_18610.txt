the thirteenth floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genre - making. if hadn ' t recently watched the matrix open your eyes - - both of which are similar but far superior - - i might have been a little nicer to this picture. craig bierko makes an adequate as douglas, the rich co - creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss (armin mueller - stahl ). everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one, and characters stare each other for maddeningly - long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level. the acting is okay, but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of, and features a script (co - penned by director josef rusnak) loaded with cliches and stock characters. are individual scenes and ideas that work - - like the thought of a sentient computer program - - but none of the film ' s strengths are recognized to any degree. producer roland emmerich, based on this and his previous directorial efforts, seems - bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science - fiction.
