steve martin is one of the funniest men alive. if can take that as a true statement, then your disappointment at this film will equal mine. martin be hilarious, creating some of the best laugh - out - loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters. you won ' t find any of them here. the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit. bilko (and the name ' t an accident) is the head of an army motor pool group, but passion is his schemes. every involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair - brained plan to get quick while outwitting the officers of the base. " mchale ' s navy " ' s granddaddy. that ' s the idea this movie too, but the difference is that, as far - fetched and usually goofy as the television series was, it was funny. there is not one laugh in the film. the re - make retains the goofiness, but not the entertainment. everything is just too clean. it obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it. it all looks new, even the old beat - up stuff. martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role. in the original, phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness. martin ' s bilko is a pale imitation. the only semi - bright spot is phil hartman as bilko ' s arch - enemy. it ' s not saying much, considering martin ' s lackluster character, but leaves him in the dust.
