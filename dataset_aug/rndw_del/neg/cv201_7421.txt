i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3. the best way can put is that it ' s funky. i know this is an odd question, but remember the opening music of " police academy 4: citizens on ", when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits? it ' s just like that. anyway, part 3 takes place day after the events of part 2 (so still 1985 ). this time, a group of horny teens (who bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed. it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life (must have been between parts 1 and 2) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me. she ' s the lone survivor this time. part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3 - d, and from what i can tell from video, it looks though they may been fairly decent effects. jason had long, wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2. now, one day later he ' s completely bald. also, it being one day later, it can ' t be friday the 13th now can it? oh well. steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series.
