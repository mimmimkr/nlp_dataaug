the comet - disaster flick is a disaster alright. directed by tony scott (top gun ), it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth. and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble. jeez. after a great opening, in which american spaceship, plus the city of york, are completely destroyed by a comet shower, nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy. they hire the world ' s best oil driller (bruce willis ), and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem. that ' s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier, isn ' t it? the action in so over the top, , and too ludicrous for words, i had to and hit my head with my notebook a couple times. i was not alone. plus, to see wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film armageddon is a waste of the actor ' talents. the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots. the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out - perform deep impact. producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon.
