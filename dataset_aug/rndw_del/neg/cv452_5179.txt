a big, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch, the great white hype samuel l. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay - per - view revenues is to " invent " a white contender (peter berg) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " (damon wayans ). (the logic is that people will pay more to see vs. white than black vs. black.) he may be right, in an absurdly accurate way, but the film ' t give us a reason to care. as a scathing sports spoof, hype is just: unfunny, unfocused, and, at times, just plain pointless. as a commentary on race relations, it ' s even * less * effective. the dialogue is the best of this mess, lines like jon exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of eggs! " writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang, though we never hear enough of it. the script isn ' t strong enough, though, to support the aggressive camera work of reginald hudlin (house party ). he comes across as absolute overkill. the great hype * almost * around at the end, at the big match, when hudlin attempts an extended gag of - concert proportions. with costumed dwarfs, gangsta rappers, and the " champ " dressed as death, only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should ' ve been.
