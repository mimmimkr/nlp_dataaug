its a stupid little movie that trys to be and sophisticated, yet trys a bit too hard. with the voices of woody allen, gene, lopez, sylvester stallone, and sharon stone, this computer - animated yak - fest (think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising) is one for the ant - eaters. the main story is the independence of a worker named z (allen ). he more to life than just digging away underground the colony. when he finds out about ` `, " a mythical place where all insects can run free, z, along with his colony ' s princess (stone ), journey out into the world to find a meaning for life. about 15 minutes into the picture, i began to wonder what the point of the. halfway through, i still didn ' t have an answer. by the end credits, i just gave up and ran out. antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice - overs. allen is nonchalant, while i have guessed, if i hadn ' t seen her in the mighty and basic instinct, stone can ' t act, even a cartoon. this film is one for the bugs: unfunny and extremely dull. hey, a bug ' s life may have a good time doing antz in.
