claire danes, giovanni ribisi, and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists, but they ' re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad, a lame - brained big - version of the 70s tv show. story has all the originality of a block of wood (well, it would if you could decipher ), the characters are all blank slates, and scott silver ' s perfunctory action are as cliched as come. by sheer force of talent, the three actors enjoyment from proceedings ' re on screen, but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a first - rate cast.
