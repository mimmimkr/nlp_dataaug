" shagadellic! ", " groovy, baby! " " smashing! " adorn the 1 / 4 page ad for this movie tabbed as " the # 1 comedy in america " as of may 8th. did we attend the same movie? ! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong, like a snl skit on steroids, and at any length it seemed unfunny. yes, the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills, and yes, the concept, with a 60s secret agent / pop icon (played by myers) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy (dr. evil, also played by myers) in the present day, had a great deal of potential. fun costumes and scenery and potential not a movie make so lets throw a hefty dose of bathroom. don ' t get me, i like a good " in the bathtub joke " as much as the next person, but to have type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money. but, the way things work these days in the movie business, a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it. i do give this film stars because the sets, , and sadly, unmet potential.
