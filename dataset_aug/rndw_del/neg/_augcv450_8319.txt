a month ago i wrote that speed was the worst film i ' ve ever reviewed on paper. i didn ' t know at the time that i ' d soon encounter and despise batman & robin, which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture worthy of your attention this summer. as directed by joel schumacher (who now specializes in batman and john grisham adaptations and isn ' t very good at either ), b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion. the plot, which has mr. freeze and poison ivy (uma thurman) planning to over gotham city and then " the vorld " (as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ), is weighted down by asides about the nature of trust, partnership, blah, blah, blah. but morals are not the point of this film - - topping each bloated, confusing action scene with next one. the garish art direction and overlit make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls. since when did city become giant las vegas? only george clooney comes out on top; he underplays nicely and pretends like he ' s in a real movie.
