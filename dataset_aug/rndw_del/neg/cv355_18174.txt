bob the happy bastard ' s review: the odd couple ii grumpy old men, it ain ' t. hell, fellow americans, it ain ' t. walter matthau and lemmon team up again for an even more worn vehicle than any of their films the past few years. odd couple ii feels terribly generic, where in the first movie, made thirty one years ago, feels like a wonderful tale. that ' s like repackaging campbell ' s soup a generic food can, really. how writer neil simon could ' ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me. throughout the movie, i really didn ' t laugh once. honestly. i mean, there were dumb situations, yeah, like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice, but they just really didn ' t seem funny me. and that car rolling off the cliff? the only way i would ' ve seen in that is if they were still in it. and the ending gets all super - mushy, too. in the final twenty minutes or so, lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one, then loses her; matthau talks to his son (a wasted silverman) about his amrriage to lemmon ' s; and, of course, lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands. ooh, i really gave a lot away there, i ' m sure. consider it a hospitable gester, you won ' t waste your time renting this muck.
