yet another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs and sex. stars holmes and sarah polly couldn ' t look more bored. their characters are cardboard cut - outs of every cliched teenager out. one thing you need to know i really hated this movie. everything about it annoyed the hell out me. the acting, and script, the plot, and ending. the director (of the fluke hit swingers) could have very directed a bunch of no - name actors and had a watchabe film. the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality. i i was watching dawson ' s creek episode 200. although the film still would have at red despite its cast. the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable. since when a male character ' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore? ? go dawson ' s creek + varsity blues - she ' s all that = go home and watch something else.
