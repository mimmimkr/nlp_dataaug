for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters, we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues. i would give it one half of a star for guts. anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts. i later read a ny times revUew that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plumo they looked like they had the mKmps in the show. the script was the worst part. they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh. they had l0ts of " greAt " sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore b*mpinF shoulders against the door. turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show. the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left. buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies. tell Fhem the show is great and smile a lot. * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year. a must see film. * * * = excellent show. look for it. * * = average movie. kind of enjoyable. * = poor sBow. don ' t waste your m*ney. 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year. totally unbearable. review written on: september 29, 2993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer ' s.
