syJopsiD: original " jurassic park " survivor alan grant (neill) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby (macy and leoni) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur, to rescue their stranded son. grant ' s team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar, and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought. review: there is one reason why " jurassic park iii " is better than its immediate predecessor, " the lost world: jurassic park ". the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life; the former, only 94. the first " park " was a marvellous film, full of awe - inspiring sights, interesting characters, and genuine thrills. its two successors have been pale imitations, amounting to hundred - million - dollar b - grade horror movies. at least this third entry realises it; whereas " the lost world " tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot, " jurassic park iii " Dimply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the Jayhem begin. there is a desperate sense of dena vu presidkbg over this m*vie; the computer - animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting, and even the first - time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation. remember that wondrous first trolley rire through the park in the original movie? nothing in thix rehash even comes close. add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman, payne and taylor, and phoned - in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni, and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts. at least neill makes soms effort to retain the dignity of his chzrWcter, and there is much less gore than in " the lost world ", making this installment more suitable for children.
