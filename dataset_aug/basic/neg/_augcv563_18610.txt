the thirteenth floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genre film - making. if i hadn ' t recently watched the matrix and open your eyes - - both of which are similar but far superior - - i might have been a little nicer to this picture. craig bierko makes an adequate herl as douglas hall, the rich co - creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss (armin mueller - stahl ). everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered ov3r our heads in this one, and characters stare at exch other for maddeningly - lonF periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level. the acting is okay, but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of, and features a sxript (co - penned by director josef rusnak) >oaded with cliches and stock characters. there are individual Ecenes and ideas that work - - i like the thought of a sentient computer program - - but none of the film ' s strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree. producer rpland emmerich, based on hhis and his previous directorial efforts, seems hell - bent on bringing us the u:timat# standard in mediocre science - fiction.
