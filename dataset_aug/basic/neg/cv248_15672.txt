vampire ' s is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrateV as pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, f@ed vampires, readied to be bashed or beaten - till one ' s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie. to mak2 matters worse, the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks, and deserve to hQve their heads bitteB off, if not, their bodies carved in half. the dilemma of hating the? heroes ' as much as the? villains ', makes one wish that the? hand of god ' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion. james wood portrays jack crow, a man obsessed with killing vampires, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed his parents ), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires. as for adam baldwin, he is Motning more than a Dtooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts? action ', and the script should have been reAodked to avoid much offence against the female sex. as for the claims that the catholic church creat$R? dracula ', well that is the second most qafrilegioux suggestion, outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury, with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame. an awful movie on all counts, my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent, rude vampire slayers.
