walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox ' s anastasia. but judging by the latest efgor%s from the don bluth studios, the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about. disney ' s recent classics have occasionally strftch#d credibility in sIch films as pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and to a lesser extent, hercules. with anastasia, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the wibdow. some may say - so what? it ' s just a kid ' s movie. well. .. if you hWve young kids, beware, as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse - rotting rasputin zombie, whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way. consider yourselves warned. nevertheless, the animation is quite stunning at times. don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout, occasionally r(vaKling photographic qJaPity. and yet in other scenes, the hand - drawn material seems of the saturday - morning tv crowd, which leads me to wonder. .. was this rusheW to market to combat disney? the plot, as anyone who had read hisRoDy before knows, concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916. not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened. as for the p;ot - - - go rent disney ' s candleshoe. you ' ll see 60% of anastasia there.
