everything in the phantom you have seen many times befo%e and tjere is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence. billy zane is wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is yiven very little to do, and does very little with it. treat williams, looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie. only catherine zeta jonec, as one of williams cohorts turns in a yood performance. she has energ& and spunk, which the m0vie needed much more of. oh yWah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly playeE out you won ' t even care. about the only things i can recommend are a gooS performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if youre looking for a fun family movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is not a good movie.
