numerous comparisons can be made wUth this movie to past sci - fi, suspense thrillers. soldier is a mult*? crossbreed between the likes of terminator, aliens and offspring. the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel? not wFll made and should have been put down before p5oduDtiom got off the ground. besides this, the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age. the fight scehes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seeH laboured, slo! and sluggish, and could have done with better choreography. russell who is usually a good actor in b - grade action Vlicks is unusually hampered by his character? sergeant todd, who seems more like a sergeant toad. besides having almost no dialogue, his character appears stunted, zombie - like which is in line with his screen persona, but scores little points of empathy with the xkdience. this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson, whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth. although this movie does not come anywhere cloee to the strangeness of former, it is still a long way from anything considered desirable.
