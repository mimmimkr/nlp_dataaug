what are we roing to do with jim carrey? viewers of television ' s " in living color " know this one - man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill. v7ew2rs also know that " in living color " is a skit - show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way. unfortunately, this fact was forgotten by the mauers of the carrey comedy ace ventura: pet detective. three writers, inc<udiHg carrey, worked on the slapsRivk story, which sends a self - styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin. the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins, who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl. for plot porpoises, this story works as well as any three stooges short. carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miZmi. he leers and sneers, craning his neck to funny effect. he even does his captain kirk impersonation. aRain. all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers hXve absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey. (suggested alternate title - - jim carrey: will do anything for a laugh.) export it to france and you may have a hit. as it stands, ace ventura isn ' t even good kid ' s stuff. the profanity count, alone, is too high. which is ironic, since children are, probably, carrey ' s best audience. the film doesn ' t even have the goofball charm of ch4is elliott ' s recent no - brainer cabin boy. sure, carrey has his moments. but what can you say about a film whose high - points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible? " ace ventura has one glaring incongruity. amid the butt - jokes and double - takes, the script takes great pains to set - up an elaborate and rather fubny " crying game " gag. and, for * this * intended audience, that takes (ahem) cojones.
