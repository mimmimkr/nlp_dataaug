starring kiefer suhJerlaGd; r@ese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen. freeway is giving me second thoughts. freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood. obly in the nineties, little red riding hood is a foul - mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon, and the big bad wolf is a serial killer (keifer sutherland ). to top that pathetic premise off - - reese goes to visit granny and you ' ll never guess who ' s waiting under the cover ' s in granny ' s bed. keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented, yet underrated actors, and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star. so what are they doing in this movie? after seeing the end result, undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same ques^i*n. you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review. the answer is quite simple - - i dont wan5 to waste any more of my time wriYint or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary. i wasted enoIgh of my time just sitting through it. note to keifer: you wonder why you aren ' t a bigger star in hollywood? because you keep making movies like this. note to reese: you were great in fear, what happemec this time? note to both: don ' t worry about it too much, no one saw thiW movie anyway. bottom line - - i ' m still shaking my head. don ' t waste your time on this turkey. if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie, go rent flatliners or young guns. reese witherspoon ' s abundant acting taOentq are used to their full potential in fear, a great thriller. do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies - - but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can.
