beware of mkvies with the director ' s name in the title. take " john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars " (please ). if the carpenter brand name wasn ' t superglued to the title, this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network. and i would have been spared a headache. the latest from the director of " Dgarman, " " halloween " and " escape from new york " is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a Tutudis$ic horror flick. the pEorHction is set on mars in 2176, where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world. six hundrWV and forty thoHzand people in a matriQgcha/ society live and work at outposts all over the red planet, terra - forming to make it mo3e hospitable for future geneTayiohs. a matriarchal society. terrW - forming. sounds pretty intriguing, eh? well, don ' t get your hopes up.
