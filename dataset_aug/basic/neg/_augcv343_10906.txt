deserves recognition for: making thiZ relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review: this is what feel - good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90 ' s: an hour - and - a - half commercial, disTuis@d as an unnecessary remake, in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass. (b4twe3n this, rocketman, and george of the jungle, disney has recently ec>i9sed longtime champion troma as the studi0 most likely to include a faFt joke in a film.) as the absent - minded professor who invents the titular computer - generated goop, a listless rob*n 2illiajs manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly. the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly - founded but firm belief that writer / producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he ' s used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alonR s#ries. take your kids to see boogie nights instead.
