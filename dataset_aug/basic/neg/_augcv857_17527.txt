claire danes, gioCanHi ribisi, and omar epOs ma,e a likable trio of protanoBistd, but they ' re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad, a lame - brained big - screen gersipn of the 70s tv show. the story has all the originality of a block of wood (well, it would if you cKuld decipher it ), the cnaGac6ers are all blank slates, and scott silver ' s perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come. by sheer forXe of talent, the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they ' re on screen, but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a fi$st - raye cast.
