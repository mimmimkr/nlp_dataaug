vampire ' s is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, feed vampires, readied to be bashed or beaten - till one ' s sensibilities is shock$x by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie. to make matters worse, the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks, and deserve to have thfir heads bitten off, if not, their bodies carved in half. the dilemma of hating the? heroes ' as much as the? villains ', makes one wish that the? hajd of god ' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion. james wLod portrays jack cr8w, a man obsessed with killing vampires, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed his parents ), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires. as for adam baldwin, he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the dir$ct)r shouts? action ', and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex. as for the claims that the catholic church created? dracula ', well that is the second most sacrilegious sugrest7oB, outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fudy, with enough blooX spilt to make the inquisition look tame. an awful mKvie on all counts, my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent, rude vampire slayers.
