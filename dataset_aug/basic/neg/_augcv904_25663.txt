it ' s a good thing most animated sci - fi movies come frlm japan, because " titan a. e. " is proof that hollywood doesn ' t have a clue how to do it. i don ' t know wha^ this fikm is supposed to be about. from what i can tell it ' s about a young man named kale who ' s one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknIwjng>y possesses the key to sqving and re - generating what is left of the human race. that ' s a finf premise for an action - packed sci - fi animated movie, but there ' s no payoff. the story takes the main chX3actegs all over the galaxy in their search for a legemCary ship that the evil " dredge " aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason. so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights, fistfights, blaster fights and more double - crosses than you can shake a stick at. there ' s so much pointless sci - fi banter it ' s too much to take. the galaxy here is a total rip - off of the " star wars " universe the creators don ' t bother filling in the basic de6ai/s which makes the story confusing, the characters unmotuva^Dd and superficial and the plot just plain boring. despite the fantastic animation and special effects, it ' s just not an interesting movie.
