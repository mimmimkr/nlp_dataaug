the second serial - killer thriller of the honth is just awful. oh, it starts deceptively okay, with a handful of intriguing chafac6erQ and some solid location work. after a baby - sitter gets gutted in the suot - ably spooky eome*ne ' s - in - the - house prologue, parallel stories unfold, the first inDo?ving a texas sheriff (r. lee emery ), a gruesome double murder, and the arrival of a morose fbi agent (dennis quaid) on the eve of voting for the local laSman ' s reelection. the second pairs a hitch - hiker (jared leto) with a friendly former rsilroaw worker (danny glover ). they ' re headed west, toward the rockies and away from the murder scene. which one is the killer? well, it doesn ' t reakly matter, ' cause when writer / first - time director jeb stuart (die hard) finally spills the beans, you won ' t take his choice seriously anyway. the whole thing goes south about an hour in, with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn ' t follow. and through the whole thing there ' s quaid, playing with the mozt intense monotony this side of stevfn sea - gal. i guess i ' m glad that i didn ' t walk out - - there ' s some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr. strangelove.
