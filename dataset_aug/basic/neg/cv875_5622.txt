everything in the phantom you haFe seen mxny times before and there is gotUing new presented yere. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence. billy zane is wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is given very little to do, and soes very little with it. treat williams, looking like rhetY hutler but sounding l&ke mickey mouse, is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie. only cqfherine zeta jones, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good perfoTmsncD. she has energy and spunk, which the movie needed much more of. oh yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won ' t even care. about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if youre looking for a fun family movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is not a good movie.
