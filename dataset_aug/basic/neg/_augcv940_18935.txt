yet another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs and sex. stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn ' t look more bored. their characters are cardboard cut - outs of every SlicUed teenager out there. one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie. everything about it annoyed the hell out of me. the acting, and script, the plof, and ending. the director (of the fluke hit swingers) could uave very well directed a bunch of no - name actors and had a watchabe film. the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any )riginAliFy. i fe>t like i was watching dawQon ' s creek episode 200. although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cWst. the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable. s7nce when is a male character ' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in h)l>ywood anymore? ? go is dawson ' s creek + vSrCity blues - she ' s all that = go home and watch something else.
