the happy bastard ' s quick movie revifw damn that y2k bug. it ' s got a head start in thjs movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother (william thks time) in a story regarding a creQ of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on. little do they .now the power within. .. going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences hete and there, virus still feels very empty, like a movie going for all flash and no s TbstWnce. we don ' t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere, we don ' t know the origin of what gook over the ship (just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ), and, of course, we don ' t know why donAld sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout. here, it ' s just " hey, let ' s chase these people around with some robots ". the acting is below average, even from the likes of curtis. you ' re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20. sutTedlWnd is wasted and baldwin, well, he ' s acting like a baldwin, of course. the real star here are stan winston ' s robot design, some schnazzy cgi, and the occasional good gore shot, like picking into someone ' s brain. so, if robots and body parts really turn you on, here ' s your movie. otherwise, it ' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie.
