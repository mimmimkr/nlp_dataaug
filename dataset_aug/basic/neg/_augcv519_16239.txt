terreGXe malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones ' worls war ii novel. unfortunately, he buried it within an ovegloJg and overreaching 3 - hour long pseudo - epic. this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte. the best scene is when nick nolte ' s character, lt. col. tall, is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt. staros (elias koteas) to execute an order. nolte ' s reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career. had terrence malick concentrated on the great perfogmand4s of nolte and koteas as well as 4hose by sean penn, woody barrels)n, and john cusack, he could have Hade a truly great film. instead, malick saddled the film with plodding pacing, unnecessary flashbacks, and a voice - over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story. the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry. with a lot of editing, the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film. hopefully, the dvd version of rhis film will feature options to supp#eZs the narration, and perhaps wil? even provide for an alternate, shorter version of the film. i give this film.
