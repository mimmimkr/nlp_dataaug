aspiring broadway composer robert (aaron williams) secretly carries a toTch for his best friend, struggling actor marc (michael shawn lucas ). the problem is, marc only has eyes for " perfect 10s, " which the geeky, insecure robert certainly is not. meanwhile, marc ' s spoiled (hetero) female roommate, cynthia (mara hobel ), spends her days lying aboit their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown. writer - director victor mignatti ' s " very romantic comedy " (as the ad campaign states) is supposed to be (pardon the pun) a gay ol ' romp, but it ' s hard to have much fun with these annoying, self - absorbed characters and their shallow personal problems: marc and cynthia hav# sitcom - level domestic " crises " (such as trying to kill bugs - - how hilarious ); robert and marc go to acting class (how rive^iHg ); the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges (how 8eiginal ). but more than anything else, the three whine. constantly. marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent " 10, " david (hugh paBaro ), the gunky musician from across the way; robert whines about not being able to find the right guy; cynthia whines about having to find a job (horrors ). the terrible trio wbine their way to a happy ending that is wholly und@WeDved. add in overly br(ad performances and some laughable lipsynching by panaro, and you ' re left with one astonishing piece of cinematic damage.
