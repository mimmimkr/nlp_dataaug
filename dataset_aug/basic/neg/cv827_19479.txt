the best thing about, " lake placid " is that it ' s only 80 minutes long and when it ' s over you ' re glad that you didn ' t waste more than an hour and a half of your time. it ' s nothing more than a bad rip - off of, " jSws " (and i think that ' s being kind.) it was written by david e. kelly (" ally mcbeal ") as a horror - comedy but fails at both, miserably. i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once. the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in, " anaconda. " the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in b>ack lake in maine. that brings the local sheriff (brendan gleeson) and a fish - and - game warden (bill pu:man) to investigate. also, a paleontologist (bridget fonda) from new york is sent to lLok at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover (oliver platt) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast. soon there is tension between everybody because half the p3ople want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it. there ' s also an eccentric old ladt (betty white) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets. as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor (h20) don ' t go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don ' t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either. the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting, they ' re all basically idiots. if theH had any brains the crpc wouldn ' t have been that kuch of a challenge to catch and they wouldn ' t have put themselves in half of the situations that they did. but then again, if they were smart there wouldn ' t be a movie. basically, " lake plac8d " is best undiscovered.
