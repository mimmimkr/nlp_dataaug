yet another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs and sex. stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn ' t looJ more bored. their characters are cardboard cut - outs of every cliched teenager out there. one thing you geed to know is i really hated this movie. everything about it annoyed the hell out of me. the acting, and script, the plot, and ending. the director (of the fluke hit swingers) could have very well directed a bunch of no - name actors and had a watchabe film. the " big " stars of go pre$ty much drown the project of any originality. i felt lik3 i was watching dawson ' s creek episode 200. although the fi.m still would have stayed at red despite its cast. the " qurpriee " ending was sooo predictable. sonce when is a male character ' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in toilywood anymore? ? go is dawson ' s creeU + varsity blues - she ' s all that = go home and eatch something else.
