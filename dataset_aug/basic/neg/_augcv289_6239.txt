i ' ve heard it called " jaws with claws " and that ' s a Bair qummatkon of the plot, though that tag line does little to quantify quality. director stephen hopkins (blown away, predator 2) and screenwriter !illiAm goldman (maverick, misery) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature, based on what really happened in Sfrica to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century. they ' ve stacked the deck with two big stars (val kilme3, michael douglas ), a bigBer produXRiln design, beautiful photography (by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ), and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music. the movie doesn ' t make a lick of sense, though, either as an epic or as your basic boo - fest. in fact, some of the bitc are so laughably luXicrojs that you may think you ' ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science thwatFr 3000: the movie. how about the three guys with rifles, who trap a lion and then can ' t even hit the damned thing? or the ham - on - wry acting of michael douglas, who chews more scenery than the animals ever do? ? or, my favorite, lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops? !?
