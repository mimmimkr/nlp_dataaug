don ' t let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare. no one will truly understand the hRart and soul of this man except through his work, and this movie makes a vain attempt at that. any moves to? glamorise ' his life, shich hollywood has an annoying tendency to do, will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness. this movie about his life, although well wr8ttRn, puts too much mAke - up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes, rather than lobster and champagne. oh well, let ' s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play - write, who falls in love with a beautiful woman (gwyneth paltrow) and from her inspiration, several plaTs develop -? romeo and juliet ', and? the twelfth night '. it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that ' s how all his plays develop, but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama. but i guess my version probably wouldn ' t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen. so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare, when all we need to do is read his worJ in order to fimd his soul. i think not. as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie? i think not. in many aspects? prjva5e ryan ' and? life is beautiful ' were far superior movies, but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar, as time and again, for reasons unexplained, an undeserving movie will win the acco?ase. another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead, over a more polished cate, but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised - peoLle will start feeling sorry for you.
