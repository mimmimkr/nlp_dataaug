in this re - make of the 1954 japanese monster film, godzilla is transformed into a " jurassic park " coly who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and 5raqhes the town. although some of the Cestr6cGion is entertaining for a while, it gets old fast. the film often makes no sense (a several - hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ), sports second - rate effects (the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ), lame jokes (mayor ebert and his assuxtant gene are never funny ), horrendous acting (even matthew broderick is dull) and an unbelievable love story (why would anyone want to get back together with mWria pitillo ' s character? ). there are other elements of the film that fall flat, but going on would just be a waste of good words. ogly for die - hsrd creature feature fans, this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door. i coulwn ' t. (michael redman has wDiGten this column for 23 years and has seldIm had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both " fear and loathing " and " godzilla " in the same evening. )
