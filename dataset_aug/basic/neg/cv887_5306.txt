this talky, terribly - plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux, an ex - new orleans cop who gets ebsna#ed in a murder - m&stert after a light - plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat. he and his wife annie (kelly lynch) rescue a little salvadorian girl (samantha lagpacan) from the wreckage and that ' s when the trouble begins. the other major players include a local drug lo%d (eric roberts ), his scheming wife (teri hatcher ), a soused stripper (mary stuart masterson ), and a shady dea agent (vondie curtis hall ). everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that ' s curious but mever compelling. based on the book by james lee burke, heaven ' s prisoners is so hadly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing. early on, we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves. nor how they eluded hoth the coast guard and the faa. later, dave is r@unitWd with a drug - abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation. huh? the whole movie is like this, perhaps the result of Eome unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf. whatever the reason, somebody should tell director phil joanou (final analysis) to recut thJs mess. in its present f0rm, heaven ' s prisoners runs only two hours plus change, but it feels like four.
