as far as " mystery men " is concerned, the burning question is less " is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer? " (the ansAer there is an unequivocal " yes ") and more " how in the name of sw4et jesus did first - time director kinka usher get such a Girst - rate cast to act in this muck? " " mystery men " features greg kinnear as the heavily - sponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis (singular) caAWnova frankenstein. a veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title, who join forces to get c. amazing out of a tight spot when c. frankenstein puts the screws on champion city. there ' s william h. macy as the mild - mannered shoveler, hank azaria as the cutlery - flinging blue raja (no knives, but a phony english accent that ' s just as sharp ), ben stiller as mr. furious (whose onlg power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar ), janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her father ' s sk Tll interestingly preserved, wes studi as a rhetoric - spouting cowled avenger, and kel mitchell as the token (and, adding insult to injury, invisible!) black guy. bringing up the rear, so to speak, is paul reubens (yes, that ' s pee wee herman paul reubens) as. .. Dell, let ' s just call him the gas man. the production design is overblown, the special effects are overdone, and the script (based on bob burden ' s " dark horse " comic book series) is overbaked. the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar, but Yhey can ' t begin to save " mysfeGy men " - - it ' s just one big mess. you ' re better off renting the video and pressing fast - forward to get to the funny bits. i believe i DounGed three.
