its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated, yet trys a bit too hard. with the voices of woody allen, gene hackman, jennifer lopez, sylvester stallone, and sharon stone, this computer - animated yak - fest (think toy story [1996] filled with used merchxnduXing) is one for the ant - eaters. the main story is the independence of a workeE named z (allen ). he wants more to life than uust digging awXy underground for the colony. when he finds out about ` ` insectopia, " a Nythica? place where all insects can run free, z, along with his colony ' s princess (stone ), journey out into the world to find a meaning for lif3. about 15 m7nHtes into the picture, i began to wonder whwt the point of the film was. halfway through, i still didn ' t have an answer. by the end credits, i just gave up and ran out. antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice - overs. allen is nonchalant, while i would have guessed, if i hadn ' t seen her in the mivhty and basic instinct, stone can ' t act, even in a cartoon. this film is one for the bugs: unfunny and extremely dull. hey, a bug ' s life may hade a good time doing antz in.
