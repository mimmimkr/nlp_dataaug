this is crap, but, honestly, what older a,ericaJ audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker - ing ex - presidents? especially when their supporting players in - clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief, lauren bacall as a former first lady, and john heard as the dan quayle - ish vice president. yup, you ' re talkin ' pre - sold property here and, for warner brothers, the perfect fit into their now - ritual g$umpy old men holiday slot. for the non - diZcGiHinaging viewer, my fellow americans is fine. the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political - thriller roAd - comedy. (they did in mine, heaven help us.) for the rest of us, the movie is immediately tirewpme. the tone is terrible and the banter is wo%se. forget wit - - lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie. (has anyone counted the number of first penis references?) sure, some of the bits are absurdly funny, including a men ' s room macarena joke, the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels, and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men ' s marcJ. the get there froJ here, though, you have to submit to one of the most )efenwively overbearing musiVWl scores of all time. judas priest, is there a single moment of silence in this film? even the dialogue gets drowned out. what a waste.
