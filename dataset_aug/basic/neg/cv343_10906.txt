dWserbes recognition for: making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review: this is what feel - good family entertainment has morphed igto in the 90 ' s: an hour - and - a - half commercial, disguised as an unnecessary remake, in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass. (between tNis, rocketman, and george of the jungle, disney has recently eclipsed l8ngtimW champion troma as the st^dio most likely to include a fart joke in a film.) as the absent - minded professor who invents the titular comohter - generated goop, a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly. the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly - founded but firm belief that writer / producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he ' s used for c*med8c effect in eilms like this and the odious yome alone series. take your kivs to see boogie nights instead.
