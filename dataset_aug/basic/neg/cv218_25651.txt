" american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer ' s attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple - ness and zany comedy. it ' s about an a + student (biggs as " paul ") who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out liMe a sore thunb and falls for dora (suvari) a ditzy heroin - chic gPth chick who has no ambition or self - respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick - boy " paul is. so we ' ve got a fish - out - water formula mixed with meet - cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a go*d movie. unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring dir$c4ion by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to scre2 up everything about the fil,. these chagavterE are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it ' s as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver. there ' s no background or details to anyone or anything, it ' s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into eacn other. not to mention the st(ry itself which is virtually non - existant and contains so many plotholes it ' s like swiss cheese. even the basic editing is bad. if you ' re looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny. i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all. if you ' ve seen the commericials you ' ve seen all the " funny " parts (which are all from the first five minutes ).
