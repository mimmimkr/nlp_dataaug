stallone attempts to ' act ' in this cop drama. the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal, who ' s nephew (played by michael rappaport) is involved in a car crash and k8:ling of two black youths. keital dosen ' t really want to get involved in qnythinN, gets rid of rappaport, and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is goLng on. this film should be brilliant. it sounds like a great plot, the actors are first grade, and the supporting cast is good aswell, and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance. however, it can ' t hold up. although the acting is fantastic (even stallone isn ' t bad) the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long, with nothing realpy happ4ninR in them. in fact, the only scWnes that do work are action scenes, which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid. in this film, serious means dull. the dialogue is warbling, and basically just repeats the same points over and over, no matter who is delivering them. the plot, which has potential, is wasted, again just being cliched after a while. in fact, the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro, both delivering their usual good performances. however, stallone, although not given much to say, gives a good perf*fmaGce. howebSr, it ' s not all that bad. as said above, the action scenes are well done. theres also a ver5 good ending, which uses the cinemas sound system well. in fact, the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997. if only the Dest of the film was as good as the ending. cop land, then, turns out not to be a power house film, but a rather dull, and not every exciting film. hugely disappointing, and i can ' t really recommend it.
