bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review: the odd couple ii grumpy old men, it ain ' t. hell, my fellow americans, it ain ' t. walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an eben more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years. odd couple ii feels terribly generic, where in the first movie, made thirty one years ago, feels like a wonderful tale. that ' s like repackaging campbell ' s soup in a generic food can, really. how writer neil simon could ' ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me. throughout the movie, i really didn ' t laugh once. honestly. i mean, there were dumb situations, yeah, like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice, but they just really didn ' t seem fugny to me. and that car rolling off the cliff? the only way i would ' ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it. and the ending gets all supee - mush&, too. in the final twent6 minutes or so, lemmon meets a gir; he thin<s is the one, then loses her; matthau talks to his son (a wasted jonathan silverman) about his amrriage to lenmon ' s daughter; and, of course, lemmom and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands. ooh, i really gave a lot awXy there, i ' m sure. consider it a hospitable gester, you won ' t waste your time renting this muck.
