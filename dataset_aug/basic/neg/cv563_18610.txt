the thirteenth floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genre film - making. if i hadn ' t recently watched the matrix and open your eyes - - both of which are similar but far superior - - i might jave been a little nicer to this picture. craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall, the r9ch co - creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss (armin mueller - staul ). everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in tjis one, and characters stare at each kther for maddeningly - long periods of time and refuQe to communicate on any realistic level. the acting is okay, but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could tBink of, and features a script (co - penned by director iosef rusnak) loaded with cliches and stock characters. there are individual scenes and ideas that work - - i like the thought of a sentient computer program - - but none of the film ' s atreGgths are recognized to any meaningful degree. producer roland emmerich, based on this and his previous directorial efforts, seems hell - beHt on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science - fiction.
