this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash. this is more about a parable of greed, and how money can become the bane of your life. yes, there are elements of? fargo ' here (the snow and cold ), although not as vivid in the blood and gore department. it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives. and how at the end of the day, the things that matter most are love, truth and honesty. altgouVh in one sense it may seem tedious, making a movie about the ugliness of greed (not box office material ), it does become tedious, not because of the morale ending, but because one expects the movi$ to end that way. this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime, the rest of the movie just spirals downward from tbere. the charqcysrs in this drama are a mixture of simple and int#llwct&al folk, brothers and friends, who all fall prey to the avarice of money. they should have perhaps thrown in someone Aenqible, level headed and not affected by greed to give the party mor@ balance. commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton, whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful. bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the gF@edier younger brother, whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife, who indirectly causes the most problems. fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars, and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath. it ' s not a sim9le plan, when you shoot everyone you love for money, unless you ' re the ,enendeX brothers.
