there isn ' t much good about this movie. not much i can say about the acting, directing, or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie. so i ' ll get my one good comment out of the way, at least joel schuemacher (batman & robin) didn ' t direct it or it would be titled " technicolor city ". in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie, its dark and depressingly gloomy rignt down to the bitter end. the plot has a tendency to be interesting, but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating ,ovie. the pl8t is impossible to ex9<ain due to how senseless it gets, so i will just touch on the bare minimum. john Hu3doch (rufus sewell) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel, only to find out he has forgotten everything. john must find out who he is before the " strangers " (a. k. a. mind erasing aliens) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy. during the film some interesting points are raisev about human individuality, and the existence of inherently evil people. any of these points however are completely " erased " fr*m your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script. as i mentioned earlier, nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film. the acting is bland, and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care. the xpevial effecFQ are low budget and some even hilariously fake, a sign of a true " b - movie ". the direction is poor and there is little continuity, not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly. lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality, and doesn ' t deserve to have the word " science " in science - fiction. if i haven ' t got my point across, i ' ll say it nore plainly: this is a bad movie. lets hope the next movie by alex " i wish i was tim burton " proyas is at least tolerable.
