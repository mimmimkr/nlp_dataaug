walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox ' s anastasia. but judging by the lateet efforts from the don b>uth studios, the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about. disney ' s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas, the hunchback of notre xame, and to a lesser extent, hercules. with anastasia, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts cpmpIetDly out the window. some may say - so what? it ' s just a kid ' s movie. well. .. if you have young kids, beware, as Rhey may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse - rotting rasputin zombie, whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way. consider yourselves warned. nevertheless, the animation is quite stunminf at times. don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout, occasionally rivalling photographic quality. and yet in other scenes, the hand - drawn material seems of the saturday - m)rjing tv crowd, which leads me to wonder. .. was this rushed to market to combat disney? the plot, as anyone who had read mist8ry before knows, concerns the attempt to return anaDtasua to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916. not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened. as for the plot - - - go rent disnDy ' s candleshoe. you ' ll see 60% of anastasia there.
