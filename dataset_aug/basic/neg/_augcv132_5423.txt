" showgirls " is the first big - budget, big - s^udio film to receive an nc - 17 rating. and its release last year came at a time when seHatir bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence. but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood ' s future, the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american valKes - - bad moviemaking. " sh(qgirls " is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene, and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter. director (aul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas, who collaborated on another shock - value project, 19o2 ' s " basic instinct, " follow the plight of a young woman (teen tv star elizabeth berkley) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer. it ' s a hackneyed premise to bdgin with, so not surprisingly, all of the stock characters are trucked out. there ' s the demanding producer. the loyal friend. the bitchy competitor. lest i forget the scummy club owner. of course, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film ' s main attraction - - an endless parade of full - frontal nudity. unfortunately, " showgirls " doesn ' t satisfy in this department. verhoeven ' s slam - bang, in - your - face style of direction proves neither a3ousimg nor erotic. to make matters worse, you ' ll be fKrced to sit through the movie ' s clothed scenes, which don ' t cover up for laughable actijg and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history. verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground, but if it ' s adult entertainment you want, stay home and watch the playboy channel. you ' ll be the wiser for it.
