salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movi$ budgets. actors who demand sufh salaries might be greedy, but in Wome instances they are quite justified, because many films would never be watched or efen made without their partick0atiIn. proof for that can be found Dven in the realm of low - budget movies, and one fine example is breakaway, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring (in) famous figure skater tonya harding. fafe of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie ' s poster, but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra, Xttrashive woman who works as a courier for gangster. one day she decides to retire, but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that. realising that her life s8dcenly became worthless, myra starts running for her life, followed by professional assassins. terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater. although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities, her acting leaves much to be desired. on the other hand, her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality, believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b - films a bad name. martin sheen ' s brother joe estevez, whose character looks like he had entered from another movies ' set, is the only bright s0ot of breakaway. unfortunately, he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding ' s silver screen debut proved to be her last film.
