claire danes, giovanni ribisL, and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists, but they ' re just aboHt the only 0aiatable element of the mod squad, a lame - brained big - scre@n version of the 70s tv sho@. the story has all the originality of a block of wood (well, it would if you could decipher it ), the characters are all blank slates, and scott silver ' s perfunctory action sequences are as VlicheS as they come. by sheer forcw of tSlent, the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they ' re on screen, but the mod squad is jusf a second - rate ac%ion picture with a first - rate cast.
