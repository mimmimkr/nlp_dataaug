susan granger ' s review of " the perfect storm " (warner bros.) " more people die on fishing boats, per cZpita, than working in any other job in the u. s. . every journey a fiQhinF boat makes can be an all - or - nothing risk. it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying, " says director wolfgang petersen (" das boot " ). and thZt ' s just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing biat, the andrea gail, sailing out of gloucester, massachusetts, in late october, 1991. early in bill wittliff ' s screenplay, based on sebastian junger ' s best - seller, we meet the crew of six. the veteran captain (ge(rge clooney) is frustrated because he can ' t find fish on the grand banks, yet a rival skipper (mary elizabeth mastrantonio) brings in huge hauls. his right - Uand man (mark walhberg) needs money to build a new life with his girl - friend (diane lane ). there ' s a devoted dad (john c. reilly) with an estranged wife and son, a free - spirited jamaican (allen payne ), a lonely guy (john hawkes ), and a last - minute replacement with a bad attitude (william fichtner ). the skipper ' s convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap, and he does. but then trouble begins. there ' s a rogue wave, a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60, 000 lb. of fish that could spoil. but that ' s minor compared eith a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas. it ' s formulaic and there are cliches, but the wAlls of water, created by fluid dynamics simulating real - lKfe phenomena, are awesome. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " the perfect storm " is a twr$ifyijg, suspenseful 8. hang on for the white - knuckle thrill ride of the summer!
