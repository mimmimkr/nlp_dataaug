the happy bastard ' s 30 - second review notting hill a cute romsHtic comedy from the wgiter of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral, notting hill stars julia roberts as anna sSott, a very popular actress with a $ 15 million asking price for movies. one day she wanders into a travel Gook ctore owned by a simple london resident (played by hugh grant ), and sparks somehow begin to fly. sure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with grant ' s slightly disgusting (but very hilarious) roommate spike, anna ' s pesky ex - boyfriend (alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ), and, on top of all that, those damn press. it ' s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy, very different from, say, a stubborn father or " not the right time " like as seen in usual flicks. roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress, and grant is skrLris9ngly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened wigh this girl. in short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs, particularly provided by spike. one tee - shirt reAlly says it all about him. in an attempt to turn on a womxn, he shows the front of the shirR, which says: " you are the most beautiful woman in the world. " on the back? " fancy a f * * k? "
