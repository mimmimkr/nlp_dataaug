tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever. not surprising, considering its tiny us $ 100, 000 budget, to date it has earned in excesc of us $ 130 million. that ' s a shoViing 100 times profi5! rumours have it that a smart internet ` marketing ' ploy was so successful in gaining cult - like fanatics, by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews, the film just exploded in the box - office, raking in millions on its opening weekend. shot in 16mm and video (i suspect . ), the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch. audiences are put in the first - person perspective in the entire mis - adventure, often wobbly and blurry at times, it takes a bit of bettinf usWd to in the beginning. this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 dUsap)ezred; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences. tbwp is simply smart. filmed to look as if it was reallj a stodk - shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project, one may suspect (like yours truly) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film - making. simply amazing in that respect, i must say. talk about impact, oh yes, tbwp does have quite a bit, in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing. i did, especially the last bit but i ' m not revealing more. you have to see it for yourself. i can ' t help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has beclme. could it be that finally, an indie - film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal? or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning? well, i guess the fact stays; tbwp is highly original, clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prLor to watching this film. no gore, no special effects, i just can ' t get over how terribly smart this film is!
