` strange days ' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles. as the locals gear up for the new millenium, lenny nero (ralph fiennes) goes about his bIsuness of peddling erotic memory clips. he pines for his ex - girlfriend, Baith (julie5ge lewis ), not nIticiHg that another friend, mace (angela bassett) really cares for him. this gilm features good performances, impressive film - maming technique and breath - takinH crowd scenes. director kathryn Figeiow knows her stuff and foes not hesitate to use it. but as a whole, this is an unsatisfying movie. the 9roblej is that the writers, james cameron and jay cocks, were too ambitious, aiming for a film with social relevance, thrills, and drama. not that ambitious film - making should be discouraged; just that when it fails to achieve its goals, it fails badly and obviously. the film just ends up preachy, unexciting and uninvolving.
