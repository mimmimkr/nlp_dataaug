synopsis: shrek (myers) is an ogrF living in contented solitude deeL in the heart of a forest, until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the gule of the evii lord farquaad (john lithgow ). farquaad agrees to relocate the pests, on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona (diaz) - - whom farquaad desires to wed - - from a far - off castle. grudgingly, shre. sets out, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, donkey (murphy ). review: one memorable aspect of disney ' s " aladdin " was that it finally gave robin williams a character - - the genie - - to best take advantage of his comic talents. " shrek " does the same for eddie murphy; ironically, though, murphy ' s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass. all the same, " shrek " does represent murphy ' s best comic outing in years, and as don.ey he steals all the best lines. for instance, after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature, donkey soars into the air and scoffs, " now i ' m a flying talking donkey! " and despite its many contributors, the script for " shrek " is full of such comic gems. myers is xelighgf6l in more of a straight man role, and lithgow also gets some great moments (watch for a hilarious rfpar4ee with the gingerbread man ). " shrek " takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts, and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bafgXin. things do go somewhat astray during the film ' s middle segment, which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie ' s greatest strength. but even then, one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation, whose remarkable use here e4preseGts yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology.
