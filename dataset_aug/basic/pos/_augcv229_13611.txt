today, war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan. steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production. the audience is tossed abou$ the theatre ditn@Dsing the horror of war. please keep the kids hom# as the r rating is for reality. tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller, set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier, private ryan (matt dam0n) who lost three brothers in the war. spielberg at time takez us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific Fattle scenes. private ryan is not for everyone, but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made. the movie reminds us of the sacrLficWE made by our ww ii fighting men and women. we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifix$, their lives so that we may lLve in freedom today. for this i thank them and for steve spKelbeEg for making a movie that i will never forget. the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999, as another well deserved oscar with be in tom ' s posession.
