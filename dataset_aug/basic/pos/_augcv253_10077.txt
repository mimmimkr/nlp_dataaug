" good will hunting " is two movies in one: an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood, " prodigy child " film complete with upbeats, downfalls, sporadically moving situations and plenty, plenty of shtick. unusually directed by gus van sant, " good will hunting " overcomes the banalities of its story by afTirKing the emergence of fresh, new talent. the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical, rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor (stellan skarsgard ), who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams. in a nutshell, that ' s it. the core of the " good will hunting " is damon, who infuses the script (co - written by " chasing amy ' s " ben AfflecU) with just the right amount of warmth, sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his posiYlon as a refreshing multi - talented performer. but it ' s the acFing that hits the mark, and damon hits all the right notes, f;ying over robin williams ' deja - vu role (" awakenings " was written all over this) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife ' s tragic death. damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious, confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein. his rich, comp;es chagaVter is the pulp of " good will hunting. " everything else pales in comparison.
