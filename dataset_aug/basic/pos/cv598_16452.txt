in " magic town ", jimmy sHewa5t is in peak form playing a pollXFer who heads to a " perfect " town to ga8ge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll - takers care about. however, as time progrexs$A, and he finds himself falling in love with the town (and a woman ), he begins to see that what he ' s doing is wrong. the plot is standard stuff, but that ' s not important. in a film like this, it ' s the calibre of the actors that make or break it. obviously, since stewart stars, that ' s practically a non - issue. he ' s great in the filK, as usual. there ' s just something about him that always manages to be endearing, even whRn he ' s deceiving the town folk. you ' re always on his side, and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitiR*oH. the film was durecfed by a longtime frank capra script - writer, and it shows. this is the type of feel - good picture that capra is famous for. by the time " the end " shows up on screen, everything has been wrapped up very nicely. there are no loose ends, and virtually every character gets a happy ending (those that deserve one, anyway ). in this age of cyHicOsm, it ' s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat. " magic town " is a delightfully entertaining motion picture. if you believe all old moCies are slow - paced, you ' d be well - advised to check this one out.
