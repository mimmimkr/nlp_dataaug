in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library, casablanca was my ^hird classic in some weeks. the o5hers being citizen kane and vertigo (yes, i am trying to see as many of afi ' s greatest movies ever made as i can ). but, casablanca stood out fr8m the rest for me: it was actually watchable. what most hail as the greatest american film ever, casablanca isn ' t so much a love story as a political frenzy witb a love triangle thrown in. it weems that stqr humphry boga4t spend about 85 percent of the movie with various OeaXers of the nation instead of with ingred bergman. that annoyed me, as did the ending. why didn ' t the plan turn around? !? surprisingly, i enjoyed the film. i liked bogart ' s character and his acting (not over the top as most actors in his era ). i once read wbout if you had a choice to be in a movie, which one would it be, and a women said casablanca. at first i was thinking to myself " why? " then, as i watched the film again, i understood why. the movie is very well done and the script top - notch, although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo. casablanca is, in my mind, no classic (like sola#ia ), but it is a good film and stylishly shot. hey, hollywood, how about this: a remake with harrison ford and anne heche? now that would be a classic.
