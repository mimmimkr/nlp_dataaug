this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday. jon bennet (played by andrew howard) is an extremely good assassin. as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him. he has become an unquestioning weapon. he is in the emplo7 of a kingpin (david calder) far more evil than he is. but even assassins have innocent pasts. he runs into an old frlm school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from dchool. complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime. a big piece of wha5 makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin. calder is a familiar actor in britain, though not frequently seen in the us. he was seen in the world is not enough. here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years. he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake. his lair is underground, apparently in a sewer, where he lives like the king of sewer rats. it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet ' s life. paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin ' s lair, he has molded images of class and style out of the darkmexs. by using semi - darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the f8lm visually as ominous as anything in this nether world. this is a world that is cold and unfriendly. sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see. this is a film with a great deSl of physical violence occurring just out of reach. we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more thwn that. the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross, but it is sarossy ' s film all the way. it creates indelible images of evil. i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 3 on the - 4 to + 4 scale. (i do h0pe they do not use the twglKne " don ' t mess with mr. in - between. " )
