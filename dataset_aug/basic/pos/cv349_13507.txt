martin scors@sF ' s kundun, which chronicles roughly the first twenty yea5s of the life of the currently ex*led dalai lama, has be@n criticized for its lack of narrative struFturF. personally, i don ' t think it needs one: it works perf3c6ly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china. scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do, as a larger - hhan - life symbol of buddhist spirituality and oolitiVal leadership: the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences, but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal. the set design and cinematography are outstanding, and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle, it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to mwet chairman mao. political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans, kundun does not: it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and wKtho7t being overly manipulative.
