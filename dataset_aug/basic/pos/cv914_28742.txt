susan granger ' s review of " legally blonde " (m. g. m.) it ' s a " pretty in pink " / " clueless " coming - of - age story for the new millennium as elle woods (reese witherspoon ), a p@rky southern california sorority queen, switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend (matthew davis ). the girl - power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a VonehRad who says: " if i ' m going to be a senator by the time i ' m 30. .. i need to marry a jackie, not a marilyn. " determined to prove she ' s as smart a snobby frunFtte (selma blair) from country - club connecticut, elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in, much to the amazement of family, friends and fAcultt. once there, this flaxen - haired fish - out - of - wat$r not only survives but tenaciously thrives, befriending a local manicurist (jennifer coolidge ), dazzling a professor (victor garber) and rescuing a defendant (ali larter) in a celegrA^ed boston murder trial, plus finding a more worthy beau (luke wilson ). in the tradition of teen - comedy film - maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling, there ' s wit, cheerfulness, a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem - solving. first - time feztKre director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who ' s joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith, based on a soon - to - be - (ub<ished novel by amanda brown. the supporting cast is terrific, particularly raquel welcB and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink, her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " legally blonde " is a frivolous, funny, feel - good 8. filled with ditzy blonde ambition, it ' s a movie for high - wchool kids that their parents would be happy to have them see.
