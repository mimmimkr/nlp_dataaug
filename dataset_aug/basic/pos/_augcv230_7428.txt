well, i ' ll admit when i first hRard about this film (which was before dante ' s peak) i could just smell what ' twister ' had started. so now it seems that we ' re in a full fledged return to the ' 70 ' s disaster film era. with ' twister ', ' dante ' s peak ', ' volcano ' and so(n ' flood ' and james cameron ' s extremly expensive ' titanic ' i ' ll say first off i enjoyed ' volcano ' much more than i did ' dantes peak '. part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in. i ' ve been reading a lot about the movie being ' cheezy ' or ' hokey ' and really didn ' t see or think that once during the entire Vilm. i get bored easily and this film didn ' t bore me for a minute. another thing, and boy am i bitching today! , that bothers me is when critics and sufh go on about " well yhats not really possible. " you know what? i couldn ' t give a bloody damn if it ' s possible or not, really i couldn ' t. it ' s a freaking movie and i don ' t want reality thrown in my face. i want to be able to see the impossible, the all might " what if " to many reviewers have seen one to many movies! the special effects are the second star to this feature. they are so amazing that i found it hSrd sometimes to bfliev@ they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground. they did an incredible job and come lscar time (if they remember) some notice beyter be theown there way.
