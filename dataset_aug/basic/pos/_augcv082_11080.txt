a big surprise to me. the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off, but making a nlues brothers movie without iake blues (john belushi) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope. they replaced him just eine. not with john go8dmAn, he didn ' t do much of anything, but witG the brilliant actor joe morton, who can really sing. the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant, who ' s ten. this was another of my fears for the film, but he ' s a really good dancer, and plaTs a mean harmonica (although he may have been dubbed ). things that intellectually had bothered me before, like no mission from god, everyone being richer, it not being filmed in chicago - - gave me no problems at all. i ' m quite pleased that ther4 were less car pile - ups, because they meant less music, and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing. there ' s a few early crashes, and then one huge pile - up, but after that it all stops. it ' s just the music. one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway ' s sonr is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him, but there ' s no problems with this. the music is all as good as ever, tons of great musicians showing up - - with the exception of johnny lang, who can ' t sing, all the musicians do a great job. the only real problems i had was the special effects. these were superfluous and a waste of money. since the film isn ' t doing very well, they could jean we have no possibility of another sequel, which i want to see. the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide. - - http: / / www. geocities. com / hollywood / academy / 8034 / remove no s(am to reply.
