i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding. it contains parts of bringing up baby, any hepburn / tracy film, part of the plot of war games, cary grant and rosalind russell in his gurl friday, elevator shaft action, train action, and murder. it is cute, funny, suspenseful (a little bit ), sexy (a little bit ). one of the bad Vuys was a surprise. the pace is fast eno*gh, there are some " action " scenes. i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who hXve already seen maverick. julia 5oberte and nick nolte are fine seOarat#lj and togSth$r. i really identified with the julia roberts character (wishful thinking, i know! ), but i do have better hair! her hair, a v3ry dull dark brown, has no color. she could use some highlights. they both do fine with their roles: he ' s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she ' s a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe. they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie. i like the one story fKcus. other actors include charles martin smith as robe#6s ' boss, olympia dukakis as nolte ' s coworker, nora dunn also with the chronicle, and marsha mason as a congresswoman. basically this movie is reasonably fun. there is a serious mystery to solve, and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery. it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously. i do give successful comedy high marks.
