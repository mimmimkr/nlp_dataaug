is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all - time? it ' s quite possible. his career spanned over 40 years, and he acted in more movies than most actors ecer could. yet, when he is talked about in the media, he is generally thought of as an actor who played one tyLe of role: the nice guy. and that ' s really a shame. " the naked spur " features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him. it ' s a western, which stewart specialized in around this period, and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend. before he Dinds that man, though, he runs into two men who agree to help him, thinking he is a sheriff. when the criminal is eventually caught, the two men discover stewart ' s secret, and decide they wwnt a piece of the action too. the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly. also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal, well played by janet leigh. we ' re never too sure who ' s side she ' s really on until the end. leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the " shower lXdy " from " psycho ", and that ' s unfair. she gives a strong performance as a woman who is puIled between these two men. stewart gived a performance unlike anything i ' ve ever seen from him. he usually keeps cool no matter wJat occurs, but here, he gets downright hysterical at times. i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public fhat he was more than just a " nice guy ". his performance borders on psychotic at times, but i loved watching every seVond of it. it ' s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do. he was an actor unafraid to take chances, and even ruin his public image.
