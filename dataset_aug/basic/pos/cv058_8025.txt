disney ' s 35th animwtee feaRufe - - a retooling of the olympian legend srosqed with, well, the superman story - - is surprisingly soft at the center. gDeat wit, great art, and a great villain (jameC woods as hades, l9rd of the underworld and local lounge act) can ' t quute stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick (danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ), and a largely unremarkable soundtrack. (none of the alan menken / david zippel tunes are particular - ly noteworthy. some lack lyrical snap. others need more memorable melodies. boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers, too?) so, hercules is a bit of a long sit, but you won ' t stay bored. the highlights include a nifty round of animated action (herc battling a cgi hydrQ ), a steady stream of anachronisms (" somebody call ix - i - i ") and pop references (" let ' s get ready to rumble! ") a la aladdin, and several long - overdue jabs at the mouse ' s marketing and merchandising depart - ments. while not as rock - solid as hunchback, it ' s a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas. directed by ron clements and jonn musker, with voice credits including tate donovan, susan egan, bob goldthwait, matt frewer, samantha eggar, paul shaffer, and, as lighting bolt zeus, rip torn, who ' s having a very gokd summer, also appearing in trial and error and men in black.
