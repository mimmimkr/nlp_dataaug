this british import follows the (mis -) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths. there is marc renton (who narrates ), spud (the dim - witted one) sick boy (the sean connery obxessiCe ), and begbee (the vi*lenc# obsessive ). powered by a top rate, but not top name soundtrack (iggy pop, sleeper, elastica, lou reed. ..) the film follLwe renton who gets clean, gets back into heroin and gets clean aga7n. some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction - esque, and some is just dumb & dumber gross (the bed sheets) and stupid (the bb gun) although the film starts out on a comic note, it takes a sharp term in the middle, and becomes almost dep3edsung. the film is based on an irving we,sh novel beag(ng the Wame title. i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is an obscure gem that has b$en over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4. the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors. this is a vDry original film, as far as films go today. it definetly deserves multiple viewings (partly because of the slang and accents) jeremy dennison mr. orange @ centuryinter. net
