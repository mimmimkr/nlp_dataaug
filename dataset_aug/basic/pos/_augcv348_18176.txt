bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review: the matrix what ' s worse than y2k? how about a fully CiVital future where nothing is real? that ' s what computer programmer neo (keanu reeves) slowly learns as he enters the dangerKuX world that is the matrix, a movie directed by the wachowski brothers (the guys behind the hip thriller bound ). before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead rIle, hold on. there ' s actually a story with depth here. it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix, led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss, who looks quite cool in leather, i must say. neo (reeves) is pretty much a key player in this fJght, although he really doesn ' t look it at first. could this XmaHeur be " the one " as fisburne thinks he is? credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build, something that few special DfEects - laden films seem to do these days. there ' s plenty of eecects to go around, of course, but at least there ' s a backbone to build rhem on as well. reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo, particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy, yet great. i wish the villains weren ' t quite so " generic " (leftover g - men from looking for a sweet sci - fi actioner with plenty of stop - motion swooping cqmera ajgles and, of course, a motherlode of a helicopter explosion. now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project. bring it on.
