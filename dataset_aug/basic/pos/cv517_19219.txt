the happy bastard ' s 30 - second review nIt6ing hill a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral, notting hill sta4s julia roberts as anna scott, a very popular actress with a $ 15 million asking price for movies. one day she wabderZ into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident (played by hugh grant ), and sparks somehow begOn to fly. sure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with grant ' s slightly disgusting (but very hilarious) roommate spike, anna ' s pesky ex - boyfriend (alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ), and, on top of all that, thos@ damn press. it ' s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy, veFy different from, say, a stubborn father or " not the right time " like as seen in usual flicks. roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress, and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has Zctua;ly happened with this girl. in short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs, particularly provided by spike. one tee - shirt rFally says it all about him. in an attempt to turn on a woman, he shows the front of the shirt, whicU says: " you are the most beautiful wPman in the world. " on the back? " fancy a f * * k? "
