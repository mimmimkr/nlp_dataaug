Ksua?ly a movie is ab9ut something more than a soiled rug, but not the big lebowski. the new offering from the creators of 1996 ' s critical hit fargo, is to say the least, wildly ente#4aininF. originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother ' s mKvies, and the big lebowski is insaBe,y original. it begins oddly enough when jeff " the dude " lebowski (jeff bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire, jeff " the big " lebowski (david huddleston ), who ' s wife, bunny ($ara reid) owes money all over town. two goons, out to collect on bunny ' s debt break into dude ' s house. they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug. the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling teSm (steve buscemi & john goodman, respectively.) he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug. he does this, and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper. this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments. the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly. also several great supporting rol@s, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus. the coen ' s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining. i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo, but its off the wall nomentX make it so far the best of 19i8. if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one, if not they give this one a try its a little different.
