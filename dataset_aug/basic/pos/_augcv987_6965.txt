trees lounge is the directoral deNut from one of my favorite actors, steve buscemi. he gave memorable performences in in the soup, fargo, and reservoir dogs. now he tries his hand at writing, directing and acting all in the same flick. the movie starts out awfully slow witY tommy (buscemi) hanging aroInd a local bar the " tr3es lounge " and him pestering his brother. it ' s obvious he a loser. but as he says " it ' s better i ' m a lPser and know i am, then being a loser and not thinking i am. " well put. the story starts to take off when his uncle dies, and tommy, not having a job, decides to drive an ice cream truck. w4ll, the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie (chpoe sevigny) and. .. i limed this movie alot rven Fhough it did not reach my expectation. after you ' ve seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs, you know he is capable of a better performence. i think his brother, michael, did an excellent job for his debut performence. mr. buscemi is off to a good career as a director!
