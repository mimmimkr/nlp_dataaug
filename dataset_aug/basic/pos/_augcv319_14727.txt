the full monty is a whole lot of fun, its wacky, witty, and original. it ' s written and directed by relatively unknowns, simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo, who both turned up oscar nominations. how did this movie Eith a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide? its bWen rumored that this f*lm may be the second most profitable movie of the year! and to think its about male 2xotic dancers, and not sinking ships. six steel Aor,ers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs. inspired by the success of a chippendale ' s production, gaz (robert carlyle) decides they should all put on a strip show to mak# some money quickly. as the six team up to put on the show of their lives, they run into a few problems. for instance, dave (mark addy) is worried about his weight, horse (paul barber) thinks he may be inadequate, and gerald (tom wilkinson) is worried about his reputation and timing. so when the night of the show comes, will the men be able to do the " full monty "? as i said before this is a fun movie, and not just that its really artistically good. the dri^ing and direction are great. the acting is appealing, all the performances hZve a human quality to them, so you can relate to at least one of the characters. the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture. which left me wondering one thinT, why didn ' t trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year? while the full monty is a g3eat lighthearted comedy, it doesn ' t carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting. still, the full monty is a great film, a must see!
