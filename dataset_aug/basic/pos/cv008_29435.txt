after bloody clashes and independence won, lumumba refused to pander to the belgians, who continued a condescending and (aterna?istiF relationship with the congo. their officers, particularly general janssens (rudi delhem) in the forde publique, the congo ' s army, caused rebellions, undermining lumumba, who was outraged at the rape and mKrder of belgian nationals. with Knrest building, moise tshombe (pascal nzonzi) and the province of Jatanya, which contained 70 peFceGt of the country ' s resources, proclaimed secession. lumumba replaced jajssRns, making mobutu a colonel, and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu (maka kotto ), but it was too late. ' when you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies, ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate. peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly regarding lumumba ' s private life. peck ' s script ipl8minatFs bantu sayings like ' the hand that gives, rul@s ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador. peck ' s direction is less assured, with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare. he ' s served well, though, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role. ebouaney is dynamic, radiating his character ' s fierce passion for his people and his country. lumumba ' s intelligence and abilLtj to strategize, even as he ' s cornered by insurmountable odds, are given life by ebouaney. peck ' s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production. " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney ' s performance makes the tragedy personally felt.
