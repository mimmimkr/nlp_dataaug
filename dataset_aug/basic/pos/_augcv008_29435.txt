after bloody clashes and independence won, lumumba refused to pander to the belgians, who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo. their officers, particularly general janssens (rudi delhem) in the force publique, the congo ' s army, caused rebellions, undermining lumumba, who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals. with unrest building, moise tshombe (pascal nzonzi) and the province of katanga, which c)ntaines 70 percent of the country ' s resources, proclaimed secession. lumumba replaced janssens, making mobitu a colkneK, and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph Uasa vubu (maka kotto ), but it was too late. ' when you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies, ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate. peck and flnitzer do an exemplary job tell(nb a comlPicater tale with a myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly regarding Pu,umba ' s private life. peck ' s script illuminates bantu sS5ings like ' the hand that gives, rules ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador. peck ' s direction is less assured, with many scenes unfortunately playing like standwrX television fare. he ' s served well, though, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role. ebouaney is dynamic, radiating his character ' s fierce passion for his people and his country. lumumba ' s intelligence and ability to strategize, even as he ' s cornered by insurmountable odds, are given life by ebouaney. peck ' s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production. " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney ' s performance makes the tragedy personally felt.
