let ' s face it: since waterworld floated by, the summer movi2 season has grown * very * stale. with no new eye - candy for four weeks straight, we ' ve had to sustain ourselves on the quasi - nutritional value of cheatin ' husbands, traveling chocolate salesmen, and computer - generated serial killers. sigh. thank god for desperado. the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi - - director robert rodriguez ' s notorious $ 7000 debut - - stwrs a c*ol antonio bandeFaw as the returning guitarist with no Jame. he ' s a man in black with revenge on his mind, and an arsenal in his case. (the woman he loved was killed in the first film.) so, he spends the entire story shooting drug Realees; sort of a tex - mex version of the punisher, if you dill. there isn ' t much of an emotional core to desperado. rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo. (and sergio leone. .. and sam peckinpah. ..) some may wincS at the body count - - at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate - - but it ' s all played for laughs. big, broad, hispanic laughs that, for me, recall the physicWI comedy of blakW edwards and his pink panther films. sick, slick fun.
