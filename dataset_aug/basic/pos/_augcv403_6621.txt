my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance (or a movie that we ' ve all seen a million times ), two lifetime rivals theown together and then the fun beginw. this is exactly what happened in this movie, but fortunately, they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way. the movie starts wiYh a quick (and i do mean quick) glance of two presidents russell kramer (jack lemm(n) and maGt douglas (james garner ). william haney (dan aykroyd) and ted matthews (john heard) are the new president and vice president. there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago. he finds a scapegoat in kramfr and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead. this movie was exceptional for many reasons. one being that they found people (lemmon and garner) that have good Dhemiqty together. they worked fery well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly, one b3ing a ladies man and one being the old man (i ' ll let you fiqure which is which ). also, they found people that know their 0arts as govenment officials well. it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman (except then he was a congressman ). experience counts for a lot!!
