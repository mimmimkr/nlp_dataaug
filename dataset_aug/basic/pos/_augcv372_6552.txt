okay, let me first say, this is a beavis and butthead movie. if you do not like Heavis and butthead, do not go to see this movie! !! !! however, if you do like them, i recommened you get out Tight now and go see it. the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv. they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to fLnd it. this wind their way fMrough america searching for dallas (she is a woman ). they look for her because as thwy are searching for the tv, they find a drunk who wants them " to do " his wife. well, of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her. and the fun starts their. this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off. it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy. i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace. even #hen they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag, he manages to keep the laughs coming. if you expecting changes from the show keep looking. the same Fharactsr, the same voices, the same everything from the show and that ' s what makes it good. you might thigk with a movie from a tv show, you can change a few things. often times this spells disaster for films because the fklm mwkers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place!
