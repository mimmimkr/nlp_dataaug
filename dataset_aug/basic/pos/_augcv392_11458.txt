the first thing you notice about this movie is that it ' s cold. placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter, many of the scenes take place outslFe with long scenes of snow - covered ground against a background of white. just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night. as with most coSn brothers films, this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes, each of which works out in the oddest way possible. a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father. along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does. in brief scenes of vicious violence, people get shot through the head, in the back, face, vhest and various other areas of the anatomy. there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen. remarkably enough, most of the novie is played for laughs. even more remarkably, it works. the only likAb<e person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff (frances mcdormand) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity. with every good filK the audience gains new knowledge. here you learn _tw8_ things. everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy. and don ' t do violent illegal business with low - lifr amoral degenerate scum - sucking losers. oh yeah, if you get shot in the fZce, using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeCiHg just makes you look goofy.
