a costume drama set in the 1500s, england, elizabeth is a lush, romantic, political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one. when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens, the royal family, so to speak, are upset that a protestant should be crowened, and not another ca^hooic, plus, the new queen, elizabeth i (cate blanchette ), was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary ' s father. the persecution over catholics and protestants isn ' t the only majority in elizabeth. elizabeth i must face the decLsioB to gJve up personal pleasures, and her lover (joseph fiennes of shakes(ezge in love ), in order to rule, successfully, the country, which she did for 40 more years. both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era, and both feature a queen elizabeth i (judi d@nch plays her in lovr ), or Dourse. yet, i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love, not ,ust because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i, but because i found blanchette a more powerful, hypnotic sense for the role. elizabeth, also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough, is my pick for the best picrur2 of 1998 awxrd. it ' s a dynamic, important, breathtaking film of loyalty, power, greed, and trust. shakespeare would die for the book rights.
