susan granger ' s review of " the closet " (miramax films) in this hilarious french farce, a shy, boring accountant (daniel auteil) named francois pignon discovers he ' s going to be fired from his job at a condom factory. lonely and distraught, he c*ntempIaGes suicide. but then he runs into belone (michel aumont ), an $lderlU homosexual neighbor, who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to igtimidSge management. as evidence, belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather - clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon ' s boss. when the racy Znapsh9ts start circulating around the factory, not only does pignIn get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man. his lusty supervisor (michele laroque) is so intrigued that she wonders if, perhaps, she could change his secual preferences. even his ex - wife (alexandra vandernoot) and indifferent teenage son (stanislas crevillen) drop their diZdwin. but not everyone is enchanted. a mucho macho co - worke$ felix (gerard depardieu ), a self - righteous homophobe, is stunned and repulsed when he ' s forced by the pr director (thierry lhermite) to grovel and coIrt pignon ' s friendship or risk losing his own job. writer / director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness, veering off - track only occasionally into pedophilia. daniel auteuil (" the widow of saint - pierre ") is delightful - particularly with a blown - up condom perched on his head, riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained, and effective, prrforNanses. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " the closet " is a frankly sexual, adult 8. it ' s so clever, in fact, that hollywood is already planning to re - make it in english, like " la cage aux folles.
