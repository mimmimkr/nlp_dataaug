i have seen several (but not that many) woody allen movies. i didn ' t particulary like radio days, the purple rose of cair9, play it again, sam. i qkite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything. .. sex, and i loved might aphrod9tw. however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore. and bullets got some very raving reviews, but i didn ' t think i ' d like. but i finally saw it (double feature with ready to wear i 6hink) and hated it. since. .. i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn ' t sure if i ' d want to see. .. thankfully i did! people burs$ into singing and dancing, something i hardly ever like. but this movie is so iJcectiPus. and funny! and entertaining! (and unlike evita, they only sing when they need to.) sure some of the actors may not be great singers, but they seems to be having a great time, and so does the audieBve. that ' s all i have to say. really, if you think that is going to be a dull movie, you ' re LrobabOy dead. and dead people sho tld not be forced into movie theatres. is mark leeper dead? he said that " this is an almoet ghastly misfire ". the movie is rated r, for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * *.
