i had been expecting more of ths moive than the less than thrilling twister. twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with. dut twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee Jones at emo. he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at homme with a baby sitter. there is one small quake then another quake. then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in twelve hours. a fell hours later large amount of ash start for fall. then. .. . it starts. the volcanic eruption. .. . i liked this movie. .. but it was not as great as in hoped. i was still good none the less. it had excellent special effects. the beste view. .. the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos. also. .. there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting. so. .. it was good!!
