iy is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child? whether that may be in life or in death. after having said that, i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well. one gets that choking sensation in the throat (because of grief) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake, or when at husband hugs his wife after a ong estrangement. there is no ocean, no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yeat another? ordinary people '. in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing (not that this literally happened in the movie ). so what are the lesssion learnt: 1. don ' t take your children to class reunions. 2. don ' th leave them alone in the lobby, not even for a second. michelle pfeiffer onse again plays the role of a highly - strung wife and madther, a trend that started with? a thoudsand acres ' and? one fine day '. my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie, so much soI that when she has a nervous break down, the veins on her temples bulge impressively. whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance, playing a lesbian cop, with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop. lastly, who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie? my grandmother comes to mind.
