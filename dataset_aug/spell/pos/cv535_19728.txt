it ' s la curious thing - i ' ve found that when willis is not called on to carrier the whole movie, he ' s much better and so is the movie. even though, in the sixth sense he is the " name ", he doesn ' t have the pivotal role. that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear (cute pun, seer) a 9 year old boy who can sae ghosts. if osment was cute or precious, the director going for the maudlin, this would me nothing more than a movie - of - the - week, thankfully, osment is not only better than that, but in some instances, blows everyone else off the screen in e bravura performance. we get tho see his fears, vulnerabilities, strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i ' ve seen this year. the whole cast matches him in quality, with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches tje subject matter. one thing about this movie, its target. this isn ' t a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest, this is more what i ' d call a supernatural drama, more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup. one caveat: there ' s a lovely twist in the movie, something like the usual suspects, where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen. i wos extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto, before any hype or critical reviews were out, so i went in with no biases. if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it, don ' t let them. lot the director explain on his own pace and you ' all enjoy the movie vastly more.
