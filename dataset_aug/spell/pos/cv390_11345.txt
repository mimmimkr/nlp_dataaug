S. president or a comic book villian, but instead playing jack nicjolson, and playing him full force. all of this adds up to this year ' s funniest comedy, a creative, witty, and scathing film from james l. brooks, and brooks gets award - worthy performances from the entire cast. a winnig in every aspect, and a truly delicious slice of cyncial life.
