bruce lee was a bigger - than - life martial artist (and) actor. bruce ' s unique character (in. e. , self - produced sound effects, etc.) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor, james lee. the story is told from his whife linda ' s point of view where she put a lot of family and partical side of bruce lee ' s life. however, you can ' t help but like, whenevery the fight scenes are on, what he can does with his body annd that familiar bruce attitude and character. i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee ' s life before he became famous: scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english. it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else. scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike trougth the american college looking at the (all - white) students, cheerleaders, em athletes. it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes. in conclusion, the movie was well made, it produced a realization of who bruce lee was, and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor. and the fighting scenes were all exellent. so go see it and enjoy the movie. p. s. if you have seen tht movie unforgiven by clint eastwood, then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after tha unforgiven.
