i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding. it contains parts of biringing up baby, any hepburn / tracy film, part of the plot of war games, cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday, elevetor shaft action, train action, and murder. it is cute, funny, suspenseful (a little bit ), sexy (at little bit ). one of the bad guys was a surprise. the pace is fast enough, there are some " action " scenes. i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seems maverick. julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together. i really identified with the julia roberts character (wishful thinking, i know! ), but i do have better hair! her hair, a very dull dark brown, has no color. she could use some highlights. they both do fine with their roles: he ' s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she ' s a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe. they hae great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one base throughout this movie. i like tge one story focus. other actors include charles martin smith as roberts ' boss, olympia dukakis as nolte ' s coworker, nora dunn also with the chronicle, and marsha mason as a congresswoman. basically this movie is reasonably fun. there is e serious mystery to solv, and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery. it is a pleasant change od pace from movies that take themselves seriously. i do give successful comedy high marks.
