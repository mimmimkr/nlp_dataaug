synopsis: an attractive mute makeup artist, working on an ultra - cheesy slasher movie in moscow, witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians. meanwhile, the artist ' s sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her. comments: mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it. drawn by the clever artwork on the video box, i rented the film expecting a complete turkey. mute witness, however, was original, offbeat, and well - made. it ' s one of thse cool litile finds that no one seems to know about. i ' ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit, and it may be seen, on occasion, on the independient film channel. the first hr of mute witness is extremely tense, as billy, the quite believable mute heroine, sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute whyle filming an illegal snuff film. the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy ' s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures. to throw a curveball into the fray, billy ' s sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some geniously funny scenes. a disappointingly trite end and occasional comic blunders are the noly two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film. look for alec guinness (obi - wan kenobi from the firs star wars trilogy) in a small role as the evil reaper. definately check this movie out; although, as de word of warning, it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren ' t for the squeamish.
