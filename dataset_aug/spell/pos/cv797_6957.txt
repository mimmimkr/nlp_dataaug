i have seen several (but not that many) woody allen movies. i didn ' t particulary like radio days, the purple rose of cairo, play it again, sam. i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything. .. sex, and i loved might aphrodite. however i found bullets over Broadway to be a snoozing bore. and bullets got some very raving reviews, butttt i didn ' t think i ' d like. but i finally saw it (double feature with ready to wear i think) and hated it. since. .. i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn ' t sure if i ' d want to see. .. thankfully I’ve did! people burst into siging and dancing, something i hardly ever like. but this movie is so infectious. and funny! and entertaining! (and unlike evita, they onle sing when they need to.) sure some of the actors may not be great singers, but they seems to be having a great time, h so does the audience. that ' s all i have to say. really, if you think that is going th be a dull moves, you ' re probably dead. and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres. is mark leeper dead? he said that " this IS an almost ghastly misfire ". the movie is rated r, for * one * use od the word motherf * * * * *.
