sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest. some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract ". some poerple simply call it " trash ". a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feeelings. definitely am generation - x aimed movie, a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke - based musical dream sequence. whew! anyone in their 30 ' s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film. it ' s somewhat silly, it ' s somewhat outrageous, and it ' s definitely not your typical romance story, but for the right audience, it works. a lot of hype has been surrounding tis film due to the fact thath it comes to us Frm the same team that brought us trainspotting. well sorry folks, but i haven ' t seen trainspotting so i can ' t really compare. whether that works in this film ' s favor or not is beyond me. but i do know this: ewan mcgregor, whom i had never had the pleasure of watching, definitely charmed me. he was great! cameron diaz ' s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp. the audience may find it difficult to care about her, thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him. misguided? you bet. loveable? you bet. a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometomn of salt lake city, utah. this was just one more thing i didn ' t know about this movie Whend i sat down with a faive dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke. maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise, but i think even if i had known, i would have been just as happy. a life less ordinary is quirky, eccetric, and downright charming! not for everyone, but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies.
