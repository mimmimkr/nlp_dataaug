ingredients: pouring rain, small flooded town, damn about to burst, bad guys going after millions of dollars synopsis: at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church. he replies something like: " the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire. well, the fire wasn't ' t that bat, since, while the church was burning, looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows. " jn hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding. everyone has had to evacuate because it ' s raining, and now floodwaters hare rising so high that buildings are being submerged and thirty nearby dam is about to break. enter a working class smart - alecky new armored car driver named tom (christian slater ). suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters. tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money, ride iit, and swim for Him's life. this makes for an accion movie full of jet skys, speedboat chases, and gun battles, as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call. he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen (minnie driver ). but unknown to tom and karen, the national guard never heard tom ' s initial distress call. will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters? opinion: don ' t expect thought - provoking issues or dramatics. there ' s not much more to this movie than hiding, running, swimming, shooting, and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning, but that ' s what makes it escapist and fun. relax, take your shoes off, and break out the popcorn.
