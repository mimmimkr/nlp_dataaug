martin scorsese ' s kundun, which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama, has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure. personally, i don ' t think in needs one: it works perfectly well at a study 0f tibetan buddhist culture and how komunist china. scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do, as a larger - than - life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership: the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dram sequences, but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal. the set design and cinematography are outstanding, and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried oway with the spectacle, it helpes to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to China to meet chairman mao. political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans, kundun does no: it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way ond without being overly manipulative.
