susan granger ' s review of " [[th perfect storm " (warner bros.) " more people die on fishhing boats, per capita, than working in any other job in the u. s. . every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all - or - nothing risk. it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying, " says director wolfgang petersen (" das boot " ). and that ' s just what he'll captures EN this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat, the andrea gail, sailing out of gloucester, massachusetts, in late october, 1991. early in bill wittliff ' s screenplay, based on sebastian junger ' s best - seller, we meet the crew of six. the veteran captain (george clooney) is frustrated because he can ' t finf fish on the grand banks, yet a rival skipper (mary elizabeth mastrantonio) brings in huge hauls. his right - hand man (mark walhberg) needs money to build a new life with his gril - friend (diane lane ). tihe ' s a devoted dad (john c. reilly) with an estranged wife and son, a free - spirited jamaican (allen payne ), a lonely guy (john hawkes ), and a last - minute replacement with I bad attitude (william fichtner ). the skipper ' s convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap, and he does. but then trouble begins. there ' s a rogue wave, a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60, 000 lb. of fish that could spoil. but that ' s minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard hellicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas. it ' s formulaic and there are cliches, but the walls of water, created by fluid dynamics simulating real - life phenomena, are awesome. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " athe perfect storm " is a terrifying, suspenseful 8. hang on for the white - knuckle thrill ride of the summer!
