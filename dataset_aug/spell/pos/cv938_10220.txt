the idea at the center of the devil ' s advocate, which is, thus far, one of the three or four best films fi 1997, is that no matter what decision is made, evil will triumph - - god is a trickster, satan is a humanist - - " the last humanist ". he appears in many guises, and seduces many men and women - - in his own words, " vanity - - by far my favorite sin ". al pacino plays this role with relish, and gets to chew some delectable lines (" lemme givya a piece o ' inside wisdom on god. .. ", " i have a million names. .. " ), a john milton - - the devil. the main idea - - that he can appear as anyone, in any form (in this case, a buisness man ), harkens mainly back to terry gilliam ' s the time bandits. but the film, is something else, something orginal. part of what makes it so very good, is that it never takes itself too seriously - - it dabbles with morality, vanity, death, and child abuse, but doesn ' t try to become any profound study oft power. his is a marvelous confection - - cocky, funny, thought provoking. it is also entertaining. there is no way you could possibly predict tht ending - - It's pulls back upon itself, drawing purely out of the mind ' s eye. the final shot ìs more creative, more daring, more challenging, then anything in cinema since athe white sock in the coen ' s fargo. the central themes are fascinating (sometimes reminiscent of james ' the turn of the screw, and oates ' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ), and the product that is built around it really wows. its nice to know that things like this a still being made.
