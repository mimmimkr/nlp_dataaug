i don ' t know what movie the critics saw, but it wasn ' t this ou. the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring. in my personal opinion, they couldn ' t be more rong. if you were expecting airplane! - like laughs and agatha christie - intense mystery, then yes, this movie would be a disappointment. however, if you ' re just looking for an enjoyable moves and a good time, this is one to see. honest, it is. this story is about a 4th network, wbn, taking to america ' s airwaves in 1939. penny henderson (mary stuart masterson ), the station owner ' s secretary, must deal with her overbearing boss, an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite oon a moment ' s notice, partly due to the fact that thery haven ' t been paid in weeks. among the mayhem, she must also deal with her soon - to - be ex - husband, roger (brian benben) who desperately wants her back. unfortunately, her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation. while trying to woo penny back, roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn. mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny (i ' m trying to be unbiased so i won ' t tell you how amazing she looked ), although brian benben gets most of the screen time. along with the two leeds, are several recognizable faces, including corbin bernsen (l. a. law ), michael mckean (laverne & shirley) and bobcat goldthwait. the spesial effects are amazing, and fooled me (which some may argue isn ' t very difficult to do) in many scenes. although the moves sometimes goes overboard with se physical comedy, it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movies. overall, i gave it, or an, depending on what system you use. some comments collected from friends:
