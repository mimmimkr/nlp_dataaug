the happy bastard ' s quick movie review holy man more like holy crap. the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical - ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs (jeff goldblum and kelly preston) with a flat tire on their hands. somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel, a line - up aof infomercial programs featuring the lies of betty white, morgan fairchild, and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures. ity ' s here tthat he seems to hit his stride, speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales. at this point in the movie, of course, morality comes into play, particularly on goldblum, who suddenly feels he can marked the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss (robert loggia ). it doesn ' t take long for the movie to unfold into sappy must, with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points. only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild ' a face seems to have any interest in the movie. murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he ' d rather be someplace else. some maybe argue that the movie has a message, but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat. at least he has someting for us yto laught at. ..
