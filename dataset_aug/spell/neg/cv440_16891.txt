the comet - disaster flick is a disaster alright. directed by tony scott (top gun ), it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth. and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was toroble. jeez. ater a great opening, in which an american spaceship, plus the cite of new york, are completely destroyed by a comet shower, nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy. they hire the world ' s best oil driller (bruce willis ), and rsend him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem. that ' s like sending a mouse into a cat carry, isn ' t it? the action in armageddon are so over the top, nonstop, and too ludicrous for words, i had to sigh and hit my head with my nootebook a couple or times. i was not alone. plus, for see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste 0f the actor ' s talents. the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots. the only real reason for making thise film was to somehow out - perform deep impact. producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon.
