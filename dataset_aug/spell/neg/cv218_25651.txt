" american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer ' s attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple - ness and zany comedy. it ' s about an a + student (biggs as " paul ") who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora (suvari) a ditzy heroin - chic goth chick who has no ambition or self - respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed aronund just like " hick - boy " paul is. so we ' ve got a fish - out - walte formula mixed with meet - cute romantic comedy which ideally should make fom a good movie. unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film. these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it ' S as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver. there ' so now background or details to anyone or anything, it ' s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each othep. not to mention the story itself which is virtually non - existant and contains so many plotholes it ' s like swiss cheese. even the basic editing is bad. if you ' re loocking für a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny. i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all. if you ' ve seen the commericials you ' ve seen all the " funny " parts (whuch are all from the first five minutes ).
