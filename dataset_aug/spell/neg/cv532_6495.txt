this is crap, but, honestly, what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemon and james garner as bicker - sing ex - presidents? especially when their supporting players in - clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief, lauren bacall as a farmer first lady, and john heard as thez dan quayle - ish vice president. yup, you ' re talkin ' pre - sold property here and, dor warner brothers, the perfect fit into their now - ritual grumpy old men holiday slot. for thetwo non - discriminating viewer, my fellow americans is fine. the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political - thriller road - comedy. (they did in mine, heaven help us.) for the rest of us, the movie is immediately tiresome. the tone is terrible and the banter is worst. forget wit - - lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie. (has anyone counted the number of first penis references?) sure, some of the bits are absurdly funny, including a men ' s room macarena jost, the apperience of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels, and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men ' s march. the get there from here, though, you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores oft all time. judas priest, is there a single moment of silence in this film? even the dialogue gets drowned out. what a waste.
