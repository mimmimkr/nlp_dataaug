the thirteenth floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genere film - making. if i hadn ' t recently watched the matrix and open youy eyes - - both of which are similar but far superior - - I’ve might have been a little nicer to this picture. craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall, the rich co - creator of a perfectly human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss (armin mueller - stahl ). everything that wsa subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one, and charaters stare at each other for maddeningly - long periods of time and refuse ty communicate on any realistic level. the acting it''s okay, but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of, and features a script (co - penned by director josef rusnak) loaded with cliches and stoock characters. there are individual scenes and ideas that work - - i like the thought of a sentient computer program - - but none of the film ' s strengths are recognized to any meaningful dergee. producer roland emmerich, based on this and his previous directorial efforts, seems hell - bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science - fiction.
