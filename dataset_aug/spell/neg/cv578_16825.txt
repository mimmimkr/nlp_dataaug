its a stupid little moves that trys to be clever and sophisticated, yet trys a bit too hard. with the voices of woody allen, gene hackman, jennifer lopez, sylvester stallone, and sharon estone, this computer - animated yak - fest (think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising) is one for the ant - eaters. the main stroy is the independence of a worker named z (allen ). he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony. when he finds out about ` ` insectopia, " a mythical place where all insects can run free, z, along with his colony ' s princess (stone ), journey out into the world to find aa meaning for life. about 15 minutes into the picture, i began to wonder wthat the point of there film was. halfway through, i still didn ' t have an answear. by the end credits, i just gave up and ran out. antz is o mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice - overs. allen is't nonchalant, while i would have guessed, if i hadn ' t seen her in the mighty and basic instinct, stone can ' t act, even in a cartoon. this film is one ffor the bugs: unfunny and extremely dull. hey, a bug ' s life may have a good time doing antz in.
