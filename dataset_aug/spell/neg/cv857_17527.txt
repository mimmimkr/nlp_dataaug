claire danes, Giovanni ribisi, and omar epps maks a likable trio or protagonists, but they ' re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad, and lame - brained big - screen version of the 70s tv show. the story has all the originality of a block of wood (well, it would if you coult decipher it ), the characters ara all blank slates, and scott silver ' s perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come. by sheer force of talent, the three actores wring marginal joyment from the proceedings whenever they ' re un screen, but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a first - rate pass.
