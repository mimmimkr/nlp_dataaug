this is the worst movie i ' ve viewed so far in 98. the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil, sir august de wynter wearing kilt. the question is what could hive gone wrong with a potentially great idee with big name cast? the same question was probably asked of last year ' s stinker batman and robin. i feel the production got a little too smug, the script a little to smart and direccion was somehow lost in tehe chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie. my greatest criticism rests o the fact that there wos no chemistry between emma peel and john steed (thurman and fiennes )? something that was a vital element of the 60 ' s tv serial of the same name. the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks, but does not allow much room for character development and interaction, except to perhaps grate on the viewer ' s nerves. one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality. connery as si' august, does not fair better thah thurman or fiennes. his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather, mostly embarrassing and poor quality. if there is a movie you would prefer never to see, i abelieve the avengers would be a good choice. for one thing, you will not have to witness a product waht is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title. i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released, but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature, like lightning you can ' t see it coming until it hits you.
