everything in the phantom you have seen many times befour and there is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence. billy zane is wooden as the hero. kristy swanson is given cery little to do, add does very little with it. treat williams, looking loke rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse, is opne of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie. only catherine zeta Jones, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance. che has engergy and spunk, which the movie nedeed much more of. oh yeah, the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly playd out you won ' t even care. about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones, and some colorful scenery. however, if youre looking for a fun family movie, go watch the underrated flipper. this is not a good movie.
