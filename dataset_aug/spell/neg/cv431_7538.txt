" shagadellic! ", " groovy, baby! " " smashing! " adorn the 1 / 4 page ad for this movie tabbed as " the # 1 comedy in america " as of may 8th. did we attend the same movie? ! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong, like and snl skit on steroids, and at any length it seemed unfunny. yes, the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills, and yes, the concept, dealing with a 60s secret agent / pop icon (played by myers) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle him arch enemy (dr. evil, als played by myers) in the present day, had a great deal of potential. fun custumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor. don ' t get me wrong, i like a good " bubbles in the bathtube joke " as much as the next person, but to have this's type of humor by the funniest thing about your moovie is a waste of yuor talent Ande my money. but, the way things work thses days in the movie business, all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it. i do give this film stars because of the sets, costumes, and sadly, unmet potential.
