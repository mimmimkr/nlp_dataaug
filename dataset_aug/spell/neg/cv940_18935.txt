yeat another brainless teen flick, this one is about, surprise, drugs and sex. stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn ' t look more bored. their characters are cardboard cut - outs of every cliched teenager out there. ong think you need to know is i really hated this movie. evreting about it annoyed the hell out of me. yhe acting, and script, the plot, and ending. the director (of thez fluke hit swingers) could have very well directed a bunch of no - name actors and had a watchabe film. the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality. i felt like i was watching dawson ' s creek episode 200. although the filme still would have stayed at red despite its cast. the " surprise " ending were sooo predictable. since when is a mal character ' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore? ? go is dawson ' s creek + varsity bloues - she ' s all that = go home and watch something else.
