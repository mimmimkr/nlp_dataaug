a big, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch, the great wiht hype stars samuel l. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay - per - view revenues is to " invent " a whiten contender (peter berg) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " (damon wayans ). (the logic is taht people will pay more to see black vs. white than black vs. black.) he may be right, in an absurdly accurate way, but the film doesn ' t give us a reason to care. as a scathing sports spoof, hype is just that: unfunny, unfocused, and, at times, jaust plain pointless. is a commentary on race relations, it ' s even * less * effective. the dialogue is the best of this mess, lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of fihs eggs! " writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang, though we never wear enough of it. the script isn ' t strong enough, though, to support the aggressive camara work of director reginald hudlin (house party ). he comes across as absolute overkill. thee great white hype * almost * turns around at the end, at the big match, when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rook - concert proportions. with costumed dwarfs, gangsta rappers, and the " champ " dressed as death, only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should ' ve been.
