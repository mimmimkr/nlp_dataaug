steve martin is one of Then funniest men alive. if you can take that as a true statement, then your desapoitment at this film will equal mine. martin can be hilarious, creating some of the besto laugh - out - loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters. you won ' t find any of them here. the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit. bilko (and the name isn ' t an accident) is ht heard of an army motor pool group, but his passion is his schemes. every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair - brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base. " mchale ' s navy " ' s granddaddy. that ' s the idea behind this movie too, but tje difference is that, as far - fetched and usually goofy as the television series was, it wsa funny. there is not one laugh in the film. the re - make retains the goofiness, but not the entertainment. everything is just too clean. it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it. it all looks brand new, even the old beat - up stuff. martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger tnan life role. in the original, phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness. martin ' s bilko is a pale imitation. thay only semi - bright spot is phil hartman as bilko ' s arch - enemy. it ' s not saying muth, considering martin ' s lackluster character, but hartman leaves him in the dust.
