the rapid - fire formula that worked so well in airplane! , the " pollice squad! " television series, top secret! , three naked gun films, and two hot shots! movies has finally reached a desperate dead - end with spy had. even ezio gregio ' s the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over - extended spy - and action - movie spoof. leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd - 40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor (a cackling andy griffith ). the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy start cameos. yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but did mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. there is something oddly inspirating about the sight of nielsen weairng a nun ' s habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. (adolescent males might enjoy tihs mess, tho. the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead ' s alley.) beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme sonng, spy hard is barely the stock that it ' s printed on. my recommendation: duck in while you ' re waiting for another movie to start. estay long enough to Sea the camera dart inside of weird al ' so nostril and then leave. you won ' t miss a thing.
