adam sandler isn ' t known for appearing in deep, thought - provoking films, but he ' s still a rellay funny guy. musto of his movies are sucessul not because of the film making behind them, but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out. big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler ' s comic performance, and it ' s a miserable failure. sandler plays a thirty - something loser who get's attached to an orphaned young boy (played by cole and dylan sprouse ). as one might expect from the synopsis, director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative [[ann sentimental sequences, including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes avout which characters stay " good - bye " to one another; in addition, there ' s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor (urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ). there ' s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters, anc the film features passable performances from sandler, joey lauren adams (as the love interest ), and the too young boys, but the film on them whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny.
