capsule: liebes meets tod. this was a film about sex and death. a morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies. this film says something obscure about the relatinships of sex and dieth, but imparts no insights. to make matter worse this printed was poorly subtitled into english from french. 0 (- 4 to + 4) - an attractive 18 - year - old dies on a disco floor and gets sent to la morgue. one of the attendants, ben (jean - marc barr) is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia. we see him crawling away after a shock. in the middle of sex tu dead teen has come back to life. - the morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his collection of kinks. he was already part of a group that gets together for s / m sex. the revived teen, teresa (elodie bouchez) joins them. - moral dilemma of teresa ' s father. ben has abused his daughter ' s body, but in doing so hac saved her life. - part of this opaque allegory is de man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx. also involved is a man in the final stages of dying of aids, a close friend of the morgue attedant. he does not get involved in the orgies. - the subtitles of our print werw wiht, often on a white background making them often hard to read, but i don ' t think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost. - the title means " don ' t let me die on a sunday.
