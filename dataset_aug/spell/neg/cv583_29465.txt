susan granger ' s review of " two can play that game " (screen gems) since da success of " waiting to exhale, " there have been several romantic comedies about african - american professionals. this famele revenge fantasy, vivica a. fox plays shante smith, a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success: a mansion, a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky, hot - shot lawyer, morris chestnut. she ' s at a point in her lifes when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl - friends (mo ' nique, wendy racquel robinson, tamala jones ). " when your man messes up, no matter how small it is, " she smugly decrees, " yuh got to punish him. " so when she catches her hot man dande at a beer with a smart and sexy rival, gabrielle union, she devises her one version of " the rules, " a 10 - day " tough love " emotionally punishing plan to get him back. unfortunately, writer / director mark brown (" how to be a player ") breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy: you have ti like the protagonist - and shrill, self - congratulatory shante smith is a smirking, superficial, spiteful shrew who doesn ' t realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love. having her talk directly ionto the camera gets stale very quickly and the " day one, " " day two " title - card device underscores the tedium. comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut ' s boisterous best - friend, and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who ' s given a smooth makeover by ms. robinson. but the out - takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " two can play that game " is smarmy if slick 4, filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements (coca - cocola, miller genuine draft) but little else. in this r - rated (for explicit sexual language ), pseudo - hip battle of the sexes, the audience loses.
