david schwimmer (from the television series " friends ") stars as a sensitive (and slightly neurotic) single guy hwo gets more than he expected froo the grieving mother (barbara hershey) of a classmate he can ' t remember. hello mrs. robinson! though quite kute as a romantic comedy, the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march. the characters act, react, and interact at half - speed, making for ono * excruciatingly * long sit. (and what ' s with the dreary lighting?) co - writer / director matt reeves brings some nap to the story ' s midsection; the filme briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to reselve his feelings fol * another * classmate (a very appealing gwyneth paltrow ). by this time, though, most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep. those tough souls who stays with it can marvel at the sleepy - eyed schwimmer, a hound dof with a head cold, who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression.
