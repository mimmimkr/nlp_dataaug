when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain, you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie. however, since this film also featured michael madsen, more than capable character acter, this time in the role of protagonist, the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt. however, the very first secens show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana, tought policeman who raids at drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio (played by lynch ). however, the raid was only partially successful, and montana is getting the rap. sooo, he begins his own private war against gio, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt. in the process, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora (played by rosie vela) and satart relationship with her too. although it doesn ' t stink like many of the similar films can, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade accion routine. nobody in this film actually puts much effort, including madsen or lynch, and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke. the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of fomer supermodel rosie vela, who, apart from showing her more than impressive looks, shows some of the singing talent too. however, ther isn ' t reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would, in most likelihood, forget the next dayl.
