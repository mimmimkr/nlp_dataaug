supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in Africa grinds to a halt aftery aa pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898. john patterson (val kilmer ), the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation, tried to rid his operation of the lions, but fails. a world renound hunter, remington (michael douglas ), is called in and the battle, man against lion, begins. this film has a great soundtrack, ahd wonderful scenery. the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin. we only see one side of each chatacter. kilmer is a bridge builder and that ' s all wie sae him as. these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn ' t even appear to be t√'o upset about it. and the plot? it ' s jaws, but with lions. again we ' re presented with an animal that behaves not al all as it should. it appears to kill men because it just likes too. why? who knows. i guess there wouldn ' t be much of a story if iy didn ' t. the problem is that there isn ' t much of a story even though it does.
